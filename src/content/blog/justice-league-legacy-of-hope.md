# Justice League: Legacy of Hope

---

## CHAPTER 1: PRESENT

**October 25, 2026**

The world was quiet in a way it hadn’t been for decades. Cities pulsed with life; children played in streets once shadowed by fear, and people carried themselves with a kind of lightness born from safety. The scars of the past remained—monuments, memories, and names etched in stone—but peace had settled in like a fragile, hard-earned dawn.

It had been ten years since the **Tragedy**, the event that changed everything. In the years that followed, crime fell, wars slowed, and for the first time in generations, the people believed they could hold their future in their own hands.

The Justice League, having carried the burden of the world for so long, stepped back. They had won their impossible war. They entrusted the mantle of protection not to gods or legends, but to ordinary men and women: the police, governments, and a new generation still finding their way.

For the League, the fight was over.  
For the first time in their lives, they could simply… live.

### Bruce Wayne (Batman)

At Wayne Manor, laughter echoed where once only silence reigned. Bruce Wayne—once the Batman, Gotham’s relentless guardian—sat with his family. Years ago, he had married Selina Kyle (Catwoman), and together they adopted Damian, the boy who now stood at the edge of adulthood.

Today was Damian’s first day of college, and the usually reserved Bruce found himself quietly proud, though he hid it beneath a calm exterior.

Dick Grayson, once Robin and later Nightwing, also lived under the Manor’s roof. Married to Starfire, he carried himself with the ease of someone who had finally found balance between two worlds.

There were absences too.

Alfred Pennyworth, the heart of the Manor, had passed away three years after the Tragedy. The loss was still felt—his absence hung in the spaces between conversations, in the quiet corners of the home. Yet Bruce often thought Alfred would have been proud to see the family whole again.

### Diana (Wonder Woman)

Far away, across the seas, Diana had returned to Themyscira. There, she walked the sunlit courtyards of her home, assisting her mother in ruling their people.

Her days were spent strengthening ties between the hidden island and the outside world, becoming a bridge between realms. Though her sword was sheathed, the Amazon warrior still carried herself with a readiness that suggested peace was something she guarded, not something she took for granted.

### Barry Allen (The Flash)

In Central City, Barry Allen traded the crimson blur of The Flash for a lab coat. At **S.T.A.R. Labs**, he now served as head of the energy department, his mind as quick as his feet once were.

Working alongside Victor Stone, the two had ushered in breakthroughs in science that reshaped industries, powering cities more cleanly than ever before.

Barry’s personal life was just as full. He and Iris West had adopted a daughter, and today, their home was filled with balloons and streamers for her birthday.

Henry Allen, Barry’s father, stood in the corner with a smile Barry had waited his whole life to see.

### Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) & Arthur Curry (Aquaman)

Among the stars, Hal Jordan remained the Green Lantern, his oath still binding him to protect far-flung worlds.

Beneath the ocean, Arthur Curry ruled Atlantis with Mera at his side. As king and queen, they balanced duty and diplomacy, often bridging conflicts between the surface world and their underwater kingdom.

Arthur had grown into his crown—no longer just the outsider torn between two worlds, but a leader proud of both.

---

### Billy Batson (Shazam)

Billy Batson had grown up faster than most ever should. A boy granted the power of gods, he had carried burdens that belonged on older shoulders.

Now in his mid-twenties, he had begun to find his own balance between the two lives that defined him. By day, he worked as a journalist for a small but rising news outlet in Fawcett City—an echo of the man he had once admired most, Clark Kent.

By night, when duty called, he still bore the lightning, the mantle of **Shazam**.

Unlike many of the others, Billy hadn’t retired. The magic of the wizard still coursed through him, binding him to his role as champion.

Yet sometimes, when lightning split the sky on stormy nights, he wondered if the peace the world enjoyed was only the calm before another storm.

### Wayne Manor: A Call

One evening, an envelope arrived at Wayne Manor. It bore the seal of Gotham’s mayor, **James Gordon**—once Commissioner, now a friend carrying the weight of leadership in quieter times.

Inside was an invitation:  
*A memorial program in honor of Metropolis, the city lost during the Tragedy.*

Bruce read it in silence, then reached for an old device resting in his study: his League communicator.

Though retired, the bonds of the League were never truly severed.

The responses came quickly. Diana accepted. Barry and Billy replied with enthusiasm. Arthur answered with measured respect. Even Hal promised to return from the stars.

But one message hung unanswered.

The one addressed to **Clark Kent**.

Superman did not reply.

And in the quiet that followed, Bruce felt the faintest shadow pass over the peace they had all fought so hard to protect.
