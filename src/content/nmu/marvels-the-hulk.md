## Prelude

_"My name is Bruce Banner._

_I hold PhDs in Nuclear Physics, Biochemistry, Radio Physics, Engineering, Robotics, Computer Science and Medicinal knowledge._

_One year after meta-humans were officially recognized and given the opportunity to operate as heroes, the United States military decided to revive the Super Soldier Serum program._

_They contacted me._

_They believed my expertise in radiation, nuclear physics, and biology could help unlock new potential._

_During the course of the program, I made a decision._

_I injected myself with a small dose of the serum._

_Not enough to induce transformation._

_Enough to allow me to perform controlled experimentation._

_I was then exposed to gamma radiation in regulated increments while the team monitored my condition._

_There was a malfunction._

_A gamma overload occurred. An explosion. People around there assumed I was dead._

_Turns out, I survived it._

_All of Gamma was absorbed by my body._

_The exposure altered me._

_I transformed into a large, green, humanoid entity exhibiting extreme physical strength and heightened aggression. According to eyewitness reports, the entity displayed behavior described as pure, unrestrained rage._

_I have limited memories of this period._

_Significant damage was caused._

_Multiple people were injured._

_Some were killed._

_When I regained consciousness, I went to the hospital to see Betty Ross._

_I was informed by General Thaddeus Ross that I was no longer permitted to approach her._

_I accepted that decision._

_I understood that I represented a threat._

_Later, I overheard orders being issued for my capture._

_At that point, I chose to flee._

_For the next two years, I lived in isolation in a remote region of Northern New Mexico._

_I avoided all forms of digital communication._

_I did not use phones, bank cards, or any system that could leave a trace._

_I sustained myself through temporary labor in nearby areas._

_During that time, I gathered equipment and materials necessary to construct a private laboratory._

_My objective was not to escape._

_It was to find a cure._

_I was not hiding from the world._

_I was trying to prevent further harm caused by me."_

## Chapter 1

### **Quiet Before the Pulse**

Fall comes early here.

Somewhere around Northern New Mexico, the trees don't explode into color so much as they **fade**-greens thinning into rust, gold turning brittle at the edges. Wind moves through the valley in low, steady breaths, carrying the smell of wet leaves and iron-rich soil. Somewhere beyond the hills, a river keeps time.

Bruce Banner wakes before dawn.

The cabin is modest-unfinished wood, reinforced insulation, no unnecessary comforts. Everything inside has a purpose. A cot. A desk. Shelving lined with labeled containers. A whiteboard covered in equations written, erased, and rewritten so many times the surface has dulled.

Bruce sits up slowly, hand pressed against his chest, eyes closed.

He counts.

Not because he panics-but because routine matters.

Heart rate steady.

Breathing controlled.

No heat behind the eyes.

No tremor in the hands.

Good.

He pulls on a flannel shirt, boots worn thin at the heel, and steps outside. The air is cold enough to sting. Frost clings to the grass, silvering the ground. He exhales once and watches it disappear.

This place wasn't chosen by accident.

No nearby towns. No foot traffic. No cell towers within several miles. Just enough distance to be forgotten-but close enough to commute.

The lab is hidden beneath the cabin.

Not underground-**embedded**. Shielded walls. Lead-lined panels scavenged from decommissioned medical equipment. A homemade filtration system hums softly, cycling air through layers of charcoal, ion traps, and something Bruce designed himself: a crude but effective gamma particulate siphon.

It isn't elegant.

It _works_.

He spends the morning calibrating sensors, replacing a worn capacitor, logging radiation levels in a notebook he never lets out of arm's reach. The readings are lower than last week. Not gone-but reduced.

Progress.

By mid-morning, he drives into town.

Bruce works odd jobs. Hardware store repairs. Generator maintenance. Fixing old radios, welding broken farm equipment, tutoring high school kids who don't understand why numbers feel like a foreign language. He never asks for much. He never draws attention.

People like him.

Not because he tries to be charming-but because he listens. Because he explains things without making anyone feel small. Because when someone's car won't start in the cold, he's already rolling up his sleeves.

They call him _Doc_ sometimes.

He smiles when they do.

Once a week, he drives an hour south for therapy.

The office is small. Neutral. Intentional. The therapist doesn't know everything-but she knows enough. Knows about rage. Knows about dissociation. Knows what it means to live in fear of yourself.

Bruce doesn't talk about monsters.

He talks about **restraint**.

About the moment before anger spikes. About how emotion doesn't have to be erased-only _redirected_. He listens. He practices. He writes things down.

In the evenings, he trains.

Ju-jutsu, taught by a retired instructor who doesn't ask questions. Bruce learns leverage. Balance. How to fall without breaking. How to control force without escalating it.

The irony isn't lost on him.

Strength is meaningless without control.

Night falls early.

Back at the cabin, Bruce initiates the process.

Electrodes attach along his spine. Sensors press against his temples. A low-frequency pulse hums through the room as the system activates-drawing out trace gamma radiation, isolating it, containing it.

He grips the edge of the table.

Not in pain.

In concentration.

A flicker of green registers on a monitor-then fades.

He exhales.

"Come on," he murmurs. "Just… let go."

For a moment, nothing happens.

Then the system stabilizes.

Bruce slumps back, exhausted but intact. He stares at the ceiling, chest rising and falling, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

This could work.

Somewhere far away-

Concrete walls. Fluorescent lighting. Screens filled with satellite feeds, thermal scans, intercepted data.

A military base comes alive with quiet urgency.

An anonymous tip arrived days ago. Fragmented. Incomplete. But enough to trigger dormant protocols.

A name resurfaces.

Bruce Banner.

Analysts track purchasing patterns. Specialized components bought in cash. Radiation-adjacent materials acquired under different aliases. A cluster of activity forming a shape they don't like.

They assume escalation.

They always do.

General Ross stands before the screens, jaw tight, eyes unmoving.

"Find him," he says.

"And tell me what he's building."

Back in the woods, Bruce Banner turns off the lights.

The cabin disappears into the dark.

For now, the world remains quiet.

For now, the monster sleeps.

### **Phase Two: The Attempt**

Next day, around 8 pm, sometime after he returns from work, he begins the preparation to cure himself.

The calculations fill the whiteboard now-no empty space left, no room for doubt. Variables circled, crossed out, rewritten. Gamma decay curves intersect with suppression thresholds. Every margin holds a note, a contingency, a hope.

He adjusts a dial.

Rechecks a capacitor.

Runs the simulation again.

Same result.

"This is it," he says quietly, to no one.

The chair waits at the center of the lab-reinforced, bolted into the floor, wrapped in cables and restraints. Bruce sits slowly, deliberately, like a man stepping into surgery without anesthesia.

A cranial harness lowers over his head. Thin needles settle against his scalp, threading into neural ports he designed himself. Wires lock in with soft mechanical clicks.

He rolls up his sleeve.

The injector hisses as the suppressant enters his bloodstream-cool at first, then heavy. Pulse monitors attach along his chest, arms, neck. One last device goes into his mouth, biting down hard as he secures it.

Hands strapped.

Legs locked.

Spine aligned.

The computer hums to life.

"Initialization in thirty seconds," the system says.

Bruce exhales, long and steady. He closes his eyes-not in fear, but in focus.

_"You've prepared for this._

_You've controlled worse."_

The countdown begins.

Miles away, engines idle.

Tanks crouch at the edge of the forest like metal predators. Jets circle high above, silent but ready. Soldiers grip rifles, fingers resting just short of the trigger.

No one speaks.

General Ross watches from a command screen inside a camp, arms crossed, eyes burning. Satellite feeds lock onto a single point in the woods-an anomaly, faint but growing.

Beside the convoy, Emil Blonsky tightens his gloves.

"Movement?" he asks.

"Not yet," a soldier replies.

They wait.

"Five."

Bruce tightens his jaw.

"Four."

The suppressant is already changing him-slowing heart rate, dulling neural spikes.

"Three."

He whispers, almost a prayer.

"Please."

"Two."

The system locks.

"One."

**Initiation.**

The lab erupts with sound.

Suppressors flood Bruce's bloodstream, burning cold this time-his muscles seize as gamma extraction begins. Electricity surges through the conduits, blue-white arcs crawling across the walls.

Bruce screams.

Not in rage-in shock.

The monitor spikes.

**GAMMA LEVELS: RISING**

**EXTRACTION RATE: UNSTABLE**

Power drains fast-too fast. The system pulls energy from everywhere it can, ripping it through the grid like a starving animal.

Outside, the forest lights up.

Electricity dances across the cabin roof, spilling into the trees, leaping skyward. In the distance, a town flickers-lights dim, then vanish.

Alarms scream in Ross's command center.

"It's escalating," an analyst shouts. "If it keeps drawing power-"

"It'll overload everything," Ross snaps.

He doesn't hesitate.

"Proceed."

The forest explodes.

Tank turrets open fire, shells tearing into the cabin. The ground shakes as missiles strike. The lab walls buckle, glass shattering inward.

Bruce's eyes are wide now.

"No-no-no-"

The system overloads.

Electricity surges through him, uncontrolled, violent. Pain tears through every nerve as the gamma spikes instead of fading.

"This can't be happening," he screams.

The world turns white.

Silence.

Smoke rises from the crater where the cabin once stood. Flames lick at shattered equipment, twisted metal cooling in the dirt.

"Cease fire," Ross orders. "Check for remains."

Blonsky moves first, soldiers spreading out behind him.

Then-

a sound.

A low growl.

From beneath the rubble.

Bruce's voice, fractured, breaking apart.

"You shouldn't have done that…"

Stone shifts.

Metal bends.

"You've made me angry."

His eyes glowing green through the wreckage.

The soldiers freeze.

Something _stands up_.

A silhouette stretches unnaturally tall-bones cracking, muscles swelling, skin darkening into something massive and impossible. The scream that follows isn't human.

The Hulk erupts from the debris.

He crashes into the line like a force of nature-bodies thrown aside, armor crushed like paper. Soldiers fire. It doesn't matter. He swats them away, shattering the ground beneath his feet.

Blonsky dives clear as the Hulk's fist obliterates the space where he stood.

Jets roar overhead, floodlights snapping on, followed by the tanks.

The Hulk turns, framed in blinding white light-green skin steaming, chest heaving, eyes burning like twin suns.

He throws his head back and roars.

A sound of rage.

Of pain.

Of a man who almost escaped.

From the command screen, General Ross doesn't move.

He just stares.

Frozen.

As the monster he feared howls beneath the moon.

---

## Chapter 2 - The Howl

The forest doesn't stand a chance.

Hulk moves like an earthquake with intent-each step collapsing soil, uprooting trees, crushing steel beneath his feet. Tanks fan out around him, five… seven… ten forming a tightening ring, engines roaring, turrets tracking.

They fire.

Shells slam into his chest, detonate against his shoulders, explode at his feet. Hulk barely slows. He roars and charges, ramming a tank head-on, flipping it end over end like scrap metal.

Two vehicles roll forward.

Mounted sound cannons power up.

The blast hits him instantly-low-frequency waves tearing into his skull, vibrating through bone and muscle. Hulk staggers, clutching his head, bellowing in agony. Soldiers seize the moment.

"Now!"

Electrical trap nets launch, wrapping around his torso and limbs. Currents surge, crackling across green skin. For a moment-just a moment-Hulk drops to one knee.

The forest holds its breath.

Then Hulk looks up.

His eyes burn brighter.

He slams his hands together.

**THUNDERCLAP.**

The shockwave detonates outward-trees snap, soldiers are hurled through the air, sound cannons crumple like tin. The nets disintegrate in a storm of sparks.

Hulk surges forward again.

He grabs a tank by the barrel, metal screaming as he bends it backward, tearing it free. With a roar, he spins-using the tank like a hammer-and hurls it skyward.

Jets dive.

The tank collides with one mid-flight.

Fire blooms in the sky.

Gunfire rips from the right flank.

Blonsky.

Hulk turns.

In one brutal motion, he backhands him across the clearing. Blonsky hits the ground hard, tumbling, armor cracking, body skidding to a stop far from the fight.

He doesn't get back up.

The last resistance collapses fast.

Broken tanks burn. Soldiers scatter or lie still. The clearing is reduced to smoke, flame, and wreckage.

Hulk stands alone.

Then he turns toward the camp.

Ross's camp.

Command tents. Mobile screens. Personnel scrambling.

Hulk starts walking.

Each step is deliberate now. Controlled. Furious.

Then-

Light floods the clearing from behind him.

A sleek, black aircraft descends silently, floodlights cutting through smoke and ash. Its presence is calm. Precise. _Different._

Hulk snarls and turns, muscles tensing to leap-

-and stops.

A voice enters his mind.

Not loud.

Not commanding.

Gentle.

_Bruce… please. You're not in danger. We're not your enemies._

His breathing falters.

_You're hurt. You tried to fix this. I know._

The rage flickers.

_Let us help you._

Hulk's fists loosen.

He lowers his arms slowly, cautiously, like a wounded animal finally hearing something familiar. He takes a step toward the aircraft.

Then another.

As he walks, his body begins to change.

Muscles contract. Bones realign. The green fades, peeling back layer by layer, leaving torn clothing and trembling skin beneath.

By the time he reaches them, he is Bruce Banner again.

He stumbles.

Jean catches him as he collapses, exhausted beyond resistance. The others rush forward, steadying them both, lifting Bruce carefully.

They carry him into the aircraft.

The hatch closes.

The engines hum.

The Blackbird rises and disappears into the night.

General Ross watches from his screen.

His jaw tightens-not in anger, but something colder. Something unresolved.

"Search the field," he orders quietly. "Find survivors."

But when the medics reach Blonsky's last position-

He's gone.

Only broken armor remains.

Somewhere in the distance, a shadow moves away from the battlefield.

And the night swallows it whole.

---

## Chapter Three - The Offer

Somewhere far away from the battlefield, Blonsky wakes up breathing hard.

Instinctively, his hand reaches for pain.

There is none.

No broken ribs. No fire in his spine. No ringing in his skull. His body feels… _wrong_. Light. Tight. As if every muscle has been rewired while he slept.

He sits up.

The room is dim, industrial-concrete walls, medical lights hanging from cables, equipment humming softly around him. He looks down at his hands. Bruises already fading. Cuts sealed clean, not even scars left behind.

Blonsky exhales slowly.

That shouldn't be possible.

"Well," a voice says from the shadows, calm and amused.

"You came back quicker than expected."

Blonsky turns sharply.

A man steps into the light-not wearing a uniform, not wearing a lab coat. Just someone comfortable in places he doesn't belong. His eyes are sharp. Curious. Evaluating.

Blonsky swings his legs off the table, testing his weight.

"What did you do to me?" he asks.

The man smiles faintly.

"Don't be so surprised," he says. "I used a serum. Prototype. Still evolving."

He gestures to a nearby monitor where cellular structures pulse and regenerate in accelerated loops.

"Cells derived from organisms with exceptional regenerative abilities," the man continues.

"Lizards. Jellyfish. Extremophiles. Anything this planet has perfected over millions of years."

Blonsky clenches his fists.

He feels stronger.

Faster.

"I should be dead," Blonsky says quietly.

"Yes," the man agrees. "You should."

A beat.

Blonsky looks up.

"Who are you?"

The man steps closer, hands behind his back.

"Someone who's tired of pretending that humanity has finished evolving. Someone who doesn't flinch at the word _change_. Someone who understands that weakness isn't moral-it's biological."

He stops just short of Blonsky.

"I watched you out there," he says. "You didn't run. You didn't freeze. You looked at a god of rage and tried to stand your ground."

Blonsky's jaw tightens.

"I lost."

The man tilts his head.

"You survived."

Silence settles between them.

"I can give you what you need to defeat him," the man says at last.

"Not borrowed power. Not unstable accidents."

"Something earned."

Blonsky studies him. He thinks of the green giant-of the fear, the helplessness, the way bullets meant nothing.

Then he nods once.

"Tell me what I have to do."

The man's smile widens-not with triumph, but satisfaction.

"Excellent."

The lights dim.

And somewhere deep inside Blonsky's body, something **stirs**.

### **Xavier's Mansion**

Bruce wakes up screaming.

His body jolts upright, heart hammering, breath ragged-images slamming into him all at once: green light, collapsing walls, gunfire, heat, the sound of his own roar tearing the night apart.

He scrambles backward instinctively-

-and stops.

Because the room doesn't move.

No alarms. No restraints. No humming machines pulling at his blood. Just sunlight filtering through tall windows, soft and impossibly calm. The bed beneath him doesn't creak like metal-it _gives_, like something meant to hold a human body.

"Easy," a voice says.

Bruce snaps his head forward.

A man sits a few feet away, hands folded calmly in his lap. Bald. Composed. Watching him with quiet attentiveness from a wheelchair.

Bruce's pulse spikes again.

"Who are you," Bruce says, voice hoarse, already calculating exits.

The man smiles faintly. Not reassuring-_patient_.

"My name is **Charles Xavier**," he says. "And you're safe here."

Bruce laughs-short, bitter.

"No place is safe where I'm around."

Charles doesn't argue.

"Trust me," he says instead. "You'll be surprised."

Bruce looks around again. The room is… elegant. Old-world. Warm. Not a bunker. Not a cell.

"Where am I?"

"This," Charles says, gesturing gently, "is my mansion. Looks a bit fancy, I know."

Bruce exhales through his nose.

"Yeah. That's one word for it."

Charles wheels back slightly.

"Why don't we take a walk? Before I explain why you're here."

The halls are wide, sunlit, alive with motion.

People-_young people_-move through them. Some normal at first glance. Others… less so. A girl with silver eyes laughs as she floats a book beside her. A boy phases briefly through a wall to avoid a collision and apologizes mid-step.

Bruce slows.

Charles notices everything.

"This is a school," he says. "And a home. For people who never asked to be different-but still have to learn how to live with it."

They pass a training hall where controlled combat drills are underway.

"The X-Men," Charles continues, "aren't a single unit. They're a responsibility."

He gestures subtly as groups come into view.

"Core X-Men-field leaders. Veterans."

"X-Force-covert, high-risk intervention."

"And New X-Men-those still learning the way we work."

Bruce watches them move with discipline, restraint.

"You're building an army," Bruce says quietly.

Charles stops his chair and looks at him.

"No," he replies. "I'm preventing one."

They move again.

Outside, construction crews work along the edges of the property. New wings. New dormitories.

"There's been a surge," Charles explains. "People seeking help. Safety. Education."

A pause.

"I've had to expand."

Bruce's brow furrows.

"And you let them in?"

"Of course." Charles response without hesitation.

They pass classrooms now. Children learning. Laughing. Being corrected gently, not scolded.

"We teach them," Charles says, "because power without guidance becomes fear. And fear becomes violence."

Bruce swallows.

They arrive at a lab.

Modern. Bright. Familiar in a way Bruce hasn't felt in years.

Inside, a tall, blue-furred man peers into a microscope, scribbling notes.

Bruce stops dead.

"…Okay," he says. "I _definitely_ wasn't ready for that."

The man looks up, adjusts his glasses, and smiles.

"Oh, don't worry," he says warmly. "I get that a lot."

Charles gestures.

"Bruce Banner-this is **Hank McCoy**."

Hank steps forward, offering a hand without hesitation.

"Biochemist. Geneticist. Occasional poet when the mood strikes," he says. "And before you ask-yes, the fur is real."

Bruce hesitates… then shakes his hand.

Hank's grip is gentle. Human.

"I've read your work," Hank adds casually. "Your gamma suppression theories are… ambitious."

Bruce blinks.

"You don't seem scared."

Hank chuckles.

"Oh, I'm terrified. Just not of _you_."

Something in Bruce's shoulders loosens. Just a fraction.

Charles watches quietly.

For the first time since the forest-

Bruce Banner doesn't feel like a weapon.

Just a man who finally stopped running.

### **What Was Buried**

Bruce lies still on the stretcher.

The lab lights dim as a drone-sleek, circular, quiet-floats above him, projecting layered scans directly into the air. MRI-like waves pass through muscle, bone, blood. Green signatures flicker, then stabilize.

Bruce watches the ceiling. Doesn't speak.

Across the room, **Hank McCoy** studies the results with a scientist's focus and a friend's restraint. Beside him, **Charles Xavier** watches Bruce, not the screen.

The scan completes.

Hank gestures, and Bruce's blood appears-magnified, alive. DNA strands rotate slowly, strands glowing where something _shouldn't_ be.

"This," Hank says gently, "is why you're still breathing."

Bruce turns his head.

"Normally," Hank continues, "gamma exposure at your level would have killed you outright. Cell collapse. Organ failure. No second chances."

He isolates another layer.

"But you already had something in your system," Hank says. "A diluted strain of the super soldier serum. Enough to strengthen cellular integrity-but not enough to trigger transformation."

Bruce swallows.

"It protected you," Hank says. "But gamma radiation didn't just coexist with it. It rewrote it."

The DNA shifts. Locks into place.

"That change," Hank adds quietly, "is permanent. It's imprinted."

Bruce closes his eyes.

"The procedure you attempted last night," Hank continues, "would have worked-temporarily. It could suppress the genetic trigger that causes the transformation."

A pause.

"But the energy required was catastrophic. You weren't curing yourself, Bruce. You were pulling the town apart."

Bruce's voice is barely audible.

"I almost had it."

Charles speaks calmly.

"And if they hadn't stopped you," he says, "the world wouldn't be here to forgive you."

Bruce nods, shame flooding his face.

"I'm sorry."

Hank isn't angry. He never was.

"You don't need forgiveness," he says. "You need control. And control doesn't come from suppression-it comes from understanding."

Bruce exhales, shaking.

"I don't know how," he admits. "When it starts… it's like something else takes over. Like I'm not there anymore."

Charles steps closer.

"You are," he says softly. "You've just been hiding."

He places one hand gently on Bruce's forehead.

The other rests against his own temple.

Bruce feels the pull immediately.

Not violent. Not invasive.

Like a door opening somewhere deep inside him.

The lab fades.

Bruce is small again.

A house. Dim. Heavy air.

A man's voice-sharp, cruel.

A glass shattering.

Bruce sees himself hiding behind a doorway, hands over his ears. His father looms, rage uncontrolled, words cutting deeper than fists ever could.

Then his mother.

Standing between them.

Screaming.

Silence.

Her body on the floor.

Bruce's breath catches.

He never remembered this _clearly_. He never let himself.

The anger.

The fear.

The vow he made without words-to never feel anything that deeply again.

The mind didn't break.

It _sealed itself_.

Gamma didn't create the monster.

It **gave it permission**.

The memories soften-not erased, but understood. Pain acknowledged instead of buried. Fear allowed to exist without becoming rage.

Bruce exhales.

And wakes.

He sits up suddenly-too fast.

His face pales.

"I-I need-"

He gags.

Hank is already moving.

"Training room. Now."

They barely make it inside before Bruce staggers to the center of the empty space.

"Don't fight it," Hank says. "Just… release."

Bruce straightens.

Focuses.

His eyes open-glowing green, but calm.

He brings his hands together.

**THUNDERCLAP.**

A wave of gamma energy detonates outward-not destructive rage, but raw release. Equipment shatters. Walls crack. Hank is thrown back hard, slamming into the far side of the room.

The shockwave fades.

Bruce collapses.

Unconscious.

Smoke drifts through the ruined chamber.

Hank groans, pushing himself up. He limps over, kneels beside Bruce, and carefully lifts him.

A tired smile crosses his face.

"Well," he mutters, adjusting his grip,

"Looks like you're going to sleep again."

And for the first time-

Bruce Banner rests without running.

---

## Chapter 4: What Was Left Unsaid

Bruce wakes up slowly.

No gasp.

No panic.

Just the soft weight of blankets and the steady rhythm of his own breathing.

Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting long shapes across the room. For the first time in a long while, his body doesn't feel like it's bracing for something.

"You seem to enjoy sleeping in my residence," a familiar voice says.

Bruce turns his head.

**Charles Xavier** sits near the window, hands folded, watching him with quiet amusement.

Bruce pushes himself upright, rubbing his eyes.

"…Yeah," he says with a faint chuckle. "It's comfortable. I might give you a five-star review."

Charles smiles.

"I'll add it to the brochure."

A pause.

"And how do you feel now?"

Bruce thinks about it. Really thinks.

"I feel… clear," he says slowly. "There's this whole part of my life I never remembered. And now I do."

He swallows.

"I didn't even know it was missing."

Charles nods.

"That wasn't weakness," he says gently. "It was an instinct. The mind protecting itself."

A beat.

"Enduring abuse, then losing your mother so violently… most people wouldn't survive it intact."

Bruce looks down at his hands.

"My aunt and uncle," he says. "They never talked about it. Not once."

"They loved you," Charles replies. "They believed silence was protection."

He leans forward slightly.

"They thought they owed that much to your mother-to give you a chance at a normal life."

Bruce exhales, something heavy loosening in his chest.

"And now," Charles continues, "you understand where that unfiltered rage comes from."

A pause.

"We won't take it away from you. We'll teach you how to live with it."

Bruce nods.

Before he can speak again, Charles glances toward the door.

"There's someone," he says quietly, "who has wanted to see you for a very long time."

The door opens.

A woman steps inside.

She stops the moment she sees him.

Her eyes fill instantly with tears she doesn't bother hiding.

**Betty Ross**.

Bruce freezes.

For a second, his mind refuses to accept it. He stands slowly, staring at her like she might vanish if he blinks.

"…Betty?" he whispers.

He steps closer, searching her face, her hands, her breathing-_real_, unmistakably real.

"I thought you-" His voice breaks. "I thought you were gone that day."

She shakes her head, tears spilling freely now.

"Bruce…"

She runs to him and wraps her arms around him, holding him as if letting go might undo everything. Bruce holds her, pulling her in just as tightly.

He feels her warmth. Her heartbeat. The solid truth of her presence.

His eyes fill.

For the first time in years, he doesn't fight it.

He just holds her.

And for a moment-

the world is quiet again.

### Outside Mansion

The bench sits beneath a wide oak, afternoon light breaking through yellowing leaves.

Bruce cradles a warm cup between both hands. Betty mirrors him, legs crossed, shoulders relaxed in a way they haven't been around each other in years.

"Well," Bruce says quietly, staring into the coffee,

"didn't think this is how our first date would go… after everything."

Betty chuckles softly.

"Yeah. Not exactly the dinner-and-movie reboot I imagined."

They sit in that for a moment.

"I stayed off the grid," Bruce says. "Not just because of your father. Because I didn't trust myself. Every time I thought about coming back… I saw what I'd leave behind."

Betty nods.

"I knew you were alive."

Bruce looks at her.

"I didn't know where. Or how. But I knew."

She hesitates. "And I knew my father was hunting you."

Bruce exhales.

"I'm sorry."

"Don't," she says immediately. "I chose to believe in _you_. Not what everyone else said you were."

Their hands find each other between them-hesitant at first, then certain.

"After that incident," Bruce says, voice low, "I gave up on the idea of a normal life. I didn't know what to do with myself anymore."

A pause.

"If I got hurt, the Hulk healed me instantly. Nothing stuck. Nothing mattered."

Betty squeezes his hand.

"Charles helped me see something," Bruce continues. "He changed how I saw the Hulk. How I saw myself."

He swallows.

"I remembered something I lost a long time ago. Didn't even know it existed. And now…"

He looks at her.

"I'm not afraid of myself anymore. I see a reason in my rage."

Betty's eyes shine.

"I'm really glad," she says softly. "Because for a long time, it felt like you were trying to erase yourself."

Bruce shakes his head.

"Not anymore."

She smiles, then glances toward the mansion.

"Since we're already here," she says lightly, "why don't we walk around? Look at the kids."

A beat.

"You always talked about settling down. Becoming a teacher."

Bruce smiles-small, genuine.

"Yeah. I did."

They stand and walk together.

From a distance, **Scott Summers** and **Jean Grey** watch them pass.

Scott exhales.

"Some people get lucky."

Jean smiles, resting her head briefly against his shoulder.

Scott leans down and kisses her forehead.

The school hums with life.

Children gather in small groups, some floating objects, others practicing focus and restraint. Bruce stands before a chalkboard as **Storm** gestures toward him.

"Our guest today," she says warmly, "will help us understand one of the greatest mysteries of the universe."

Bruce adjusts his glasses, a little embarrassed.

"Matter," he begins, "isn't as solid as it feels…"

The kids lean in.

Across the courtyard, Betty kneels beside a young girl, guiding her hands as vines and grass sprout unevenly from the soil.

"Don't force it," Betty says gently. "Think about balance. Let it grow where it wants to."

The plants steady.

The girl smiles.

For the rest of the day, Bruce and Betty taught kids what they know, there is no urgency. No countdown.

Just purpose.

Evening settles.

Charles' calls him to the lab, invites Betty.

Before Bruce can follow, another voice cuts through the speakers-sharp, unyielding. A military chopper hovering around the property, catches the attention of the X-Men.

"This is General Thaddeus Ross."

The air tightens.

"Professor Charles Xavier," Ross continues, "this is your first and last warning. You are harboring a national threat. Return Bruce Banner immediately, or this will be considered an act of resistance against the United States."

Charles raises a hand-

-but Bruce steps forward.

"I'll go."

Charles turns sharply.

"Bruce-"

"He won't stop," Bruce says calmly. "Not until I'm captured."

A faint smile.

"But at least now… I know the Hulk won't be unleashed without my control."

Betty grabs his arm.

"No-"

Bruce looks at her, steady.

"It's okay."

He walks toward the chopper, leaving the property behind.

Betty follows.

The helicopter waits.

As Bruce climbs inside, Betty turns and locks eyes with her father.

Anger. Hurt. Years of silence.

Ross doesn't speak.

He just looks at her.

The helicopter lifts off.

Behind them, **Logan** watches the sky.

"You could've stopped him," Logan says.

Charles answers quietly.

"No, I trust him."

Far from Westchester-

A man stands in shadow.

The sound of dogs barking echoes in the distance.

He smiles.

## Chapter 5 - The Cost of Silence

The rotors cut through the air in steady rhythm.

Inside the military chopper, no one speaks at first.

**Bruce Banner** sits opposite **General Thaddeus Ross**, hands resting loosely on his knees. **Betty Ross** sits beside Bruce, eyes fixed on the floor, jaw tight.

Ross breaks the silence.

"You didn't have to run," he says, not looking at Bruce. "You could've turned yourself in years ago."

Bruce exhales.

"I was trying to disappear. There's a difference."

"And how many people got hurt while you were hiding?" Ross snaps.

Betty looks up sharply.

"That's not fair."

Ross finally meets her eyes.

"Nothing about this is fair."

Bruce leans forward slightly.

"You wanted me contained," he says calmly. "I came willingly. No civilians hurt. No city leveled. No mutants dragged into a war they didn't start."

Ross studies him.

"You expect credit for that?"

"No," Bruce replies. "Just context."

Another beat.

"You're sending me to a facility," Bruce continues. "Not a courtroom. Not a hospital."

Ross doesn't deny it.

"We're sending you somewhere secure."

Betty's voice trembles-but she keeps it steady.

"Like a weapon."

Ross looks away.

Before he can respond, a sharp tone cuts through the cabin.

The comm unit crackles.

"Command to Echo-One-do you copy?"

Ross straightens instantly.

"Go ahead."

Static. Then panic.

"Multiple hostile entities reported in **New Mexico**. Large-scale gamma signatures. Civilian casualties escalating."

Ross's face drains of color.

"Say that again."

"Visual confirmation-canine morphology. Massive. Gamma-enhanced. Not Banner."

The words land hard.

Ross grips the headset.

"How many?"

"…A lot."

He turns to the pilot.

"Change course. New Mexico. Now."

The chopper banks sharply.

Bruce and Betty exchange a look-unease rising fast.

"Gamma dogs?" Bruce asks. "That's not possible."

Ross glares at him.

"Everything you touch seems to make impossible things happen."

Bruce shakes his head.

"This isn't me."

"I know," Ross says quietly.

And that scares him more.

### Xavier's Mansion

Miles away, alarms echo through the halls of the mansion.

Screens light up with footage: streets torn apart, vehicles crushed, civilians fleeing as massive, glowing shapes tear through the landscape-eyes burning green, bodies warped by unstable gamma radiation.

**Charles Xavier** stands still, hand resting on his chair.

"This was inevitable," he says softly.

The hangar doors open.

The core X-Men move with practiced urgency.

**Scott Summers** leads the charge.

**Jean Grey** follows close behind, eyes distant, already reaching outward, followed by Wolverine, Storm and Morph.

**Quicksilver** cracks his neck.

"Big dogs," he mutters. "Figures."

**Scarlet Witch** tightens her gloves, red energy flickering faintly at her fingertips.

The Blackbird powers up.

"This isn't a rescue," Scott says. "This is containment."

The jet lifts off into the night.

Back in the chopper, Bruce stares out the window, mind racing.

"Gamma can't create loyalty," he says. "Or coordination."

Betty looks at him.

"Someone made them."

Bruce's jaw tightens.

Somewhere far away, under a desert sky, a man watches the chaos unfold.

He smiles.

### Albuquerque, New Mexico

The Blackbird touches down hard outside Albuquerque.

Dust whips across the runway as the hatch drops.

**Cyclops** steps out first, visor already glowing faintly as distant explosions echo through the city.

"Quicksilver," he says, sharp and precise. "Evacuation first. Move fast. Priority-injured, then kids, then everyone else."

**Quicksilver** nods once.

"On it."

And then he's gone.

A sonic crack ripples outward as he blurs into the streets-pulling people from collapsing buildings, yanking children out of harm's way, carrying the wounded faster than fear can register. To the evacuees, he's barely a memory-just a rush of wind and sudden safety.

Cyclops turns to the rest.

"X-Men," he says. "Let's end this chaos."

They move.

The first gamma dog bursts through a storefront-massive, glowing veins pulsing beneath warped flesh, jaws snapping with feral hunger.

**Storm** lifts into the air, eyes flashing white as thunder rolls overhead. Lightning spears down, striking the creature mid-leap and slamming it into the pavement.

Another lunges-

-and **Wolverine** meets it head-on, claws tearing through hide and bone as he drives it back with raw brutality.

From the flank, **Jean Grey** closes her eyes. The dog freezes mid-stride, lifted helplessly as she crushes its momentum and hurls it into the side of a bus.

A second wave surges.

**Morph** grins, body rippling as he becomes something massive-interposing himself, redirecting attacks, morphing again to confuse and divide the pack.

Cyclops fires controlled optic blasts, each shot precise-breaking limbs, collapsing terrain, never reckless.

Wanda uses her chaos magic, to crush multiple dogs.

The streets fall quiet.

Bodies fade. Gamma signatures dissipate.

A breath.

The ground doesn't just shake.

It **buckles**.

A low vibration crawls through the street, through boots and bone, rattling glass before a single sound reaches the ear. Storm's winds falter for a split second-not from exhaustion, but from interference.

Then-

A howl tears through the air.

Not an animal sound.

Not rage.

**Recognition.**

More gamma dogs flood in from the horizon, dozens of them, their bodies glowing unevenly, malformed but fast. They spread instinctively, flanking, herding-_coordinated_.

Cyclops snaps instantly into command.

"Jean, Wanda-contain the dogs. Storm, keep the sky clear. Logan, Morph-on me."

Before anyone can move-

The smoke behind the pack **parts**.

Something rises.

Slowly.

Too slowly.

A silhouette taller than the surrounding buildings straightens, muscle sliding over muscle like armored plates locking into place. Its skin is a sickly green-grey, stretched tight over a frame that looks engineered rather than grown. Reptilian ridges line its spine. Its eyes burn-not wild, not enraged-

**calculating**.

When it breathes, the air warps around its chest.

Abomination.

Storm's winds slam into him full force.

He doesn't move.

The gale wraps around his body, screaming, but he simply plants his feet-cracking the asphalt beneath them-and looks up at her.

Then he steps forward.

The wind breaks.

Wolverine lunges, claws flashing, carving deep into Abomination's side-

-and stops.

The wounds close as fast as they're made.

Abomination backhands him across the street, sending Logan crashing through a bus with bone-shaking force.

Jean screams as she pushes-telekinesis flaring, veins standing out along her temples. She lifts Abomination _inches_ off the ground-

-and drops to one knee.

"Scott," she gasps. "I can't hold him."

Cyclops fires.

The optic blast slams into Abomination's chest, driving him back a step-_one_ step-before he straightens, smiling.

"That tickles," Abomination rumbles.

Meanwhile, the city becomes chaos.

Gamma dogs tear toward fleeing civilians-

-but red energy snaps around them.

Scarlet Witch raises her hands, eyes glowing as she twists probability itself. Two dogs collide mid-leap, bodies folding unnaturally as reality buckles around them.

Quicksilver blurs through the streets, a streak of silver-blue-grabbing civilians, pulling them out from collapsing buildings, yanking wounded bodies out of danger faster than the dogs can track.

"Logan!" Cyclops shouts. "Dogs are multiplying-"

"I see 'em," Logan snarls, climbing back to his feet. "Big guy's not my dance partner anyway."

Morph shifts-expanding into something massive, interposing himself between Abomination and Jean, then changing again, trying to confuse, distract, slow-

Abomination grabs him mid-shift and **throws him** into the side of a building hard enough to crater concrete.

Storm calls lightning down directly onto Abomination's head.

The strike hits.

The light fades.

Abomination exhales smoke-and laughs.

"This is what they sent?" he says, rolling his shoulders. "You're not defenders. You're _practice_."

The X-Men regroup instinctively, forming a defensive perimeter.

Jean is breathing hard.

Storm is straining to keep the sky under control.

Wolverine is bleeding-but grinning anyway.

Wanda is barely holding back the tide.

Pietro keeps moving because stopping would mean death.

Cyclops looks at the battlefield and makes the call.

"We hold," he says. "We don't win."

They brace.

Above the battlefield, the chopper hovers.

**General Thaddeus Ross** stares through the open door, face pale.

"Oh my god," he mutters. "What _is_ that thing?"

Inside, the cabin is tense. Soldiers grip restraints. Betty's hands tremble.

**Bruce Banner** sits still.

Helpless.

Then-

a voice, calm and familiar, enters his mind.

_Bruce._

He looks up sharply.

"Professor…"

_You have your rage now. And you control the beast-because you are one and the same._

_I trust you._

_Save my X-Men._

Bruce closes his eyes.

When he opens them, something has settled.

He stands.

"General," he says evenly. "You have to let me fight that."

Ross snaps toward him.

"Are you out of your mind? We can't handle you _and_ that thing."

"You don't have to," Bruce replies. "I can handle myself."

Ross hesitates-fear, doubt, calculation colliding.

Finally-

"Pilot," Ross growls. "Take us in."

The chopper descends.

Bruce steps toward the open door.

Betty grabs his arm.

"Be careful."

They hug-tight, wordless.

"I'll come back," Bruce says.

The door opens.

Abomination looks up, grinning-eyes locking onto the chopper, onto Ross.

A challenge.

Bruce jumps.

The wind tears past him as he falls-mind focused, breathing steady. Images flash: **Charles Xavier**, the X-Men, Betty.

His eyes blaze green.

The transformation is controlled-muscle surging, bones reshaping, power snapping into place with terrifying precision.

He hits the ground like a meteor.

Dust erupts.

The shockwave ripples outward.

When the dust clears-

The Hulk stands.

Facing Abomination.

Abomination laughs-eager, waiting.

The Hulk throws back his head and roars.

And the earth answers.

Abomination tilts his head.

Two gamma dogs snarl at his sides-muscle twitching, eyes burning.

"Go," he growls.

They launch together.

Hulk doesn't step back.

He steps **into** them.

The first dog clamps onto his shoulder. The second snaps at his leg.

Hulk grabs.

One leg in each massive hand.

He plants his feet.

And claps.

**THUNDERCLAP.**

The pressure wave detonates outward-not sound, but _force_. Air compresses. The ground buckles. Windows shatter three blocks away.

When the shockwave clears-

The dogs are gone.

Not thrown.

Not torn.

**Erased.**

Only mist and fragments remain, raining down like debris from a storm that lasted less than a second.

Silence follows.

Abomination's grin widens.

"…Good."

He charges.

They meet in the center of the street.

Wall into wall.

Titan into titan.

The impact sends a crater rippling outward-cars flipping, asphalt shattering. Hulk skids back a few feet, boots digging trenches into concrete.

Abomination doesn't stop.

He swings.

Hulk blocks-and the force drives him through a storefront, steel beams folding like wire. Hulk answers with a punch that lifts Abomination off his feet and sends him crashing through a bus.

Abomination rises laughing.

"That all you got?!"

He tackles Hulk, driving him across the street and into a building. Floors collapse beneath them as they plummet-then Hulk twists mid-fall and slams Abomination down harder.

They hit the ground.

Hulk's fists come down like pile drivers-each blow cracking pavement, shockwaves rippling through the street. Abomination catches one punch, muscles bulging, and **headbutts** Hulk hard enough to split the air.

Hulk stumbles.

Abomination grabs him by the throat and hurls him-_three blocks_-through concrete and steel.

Hulk skids to a stop.

He rises slowly.

Roars.

And **jumps**.

The landing shakes the city.

Hulk tackles Abomination mid-swing, driving him through a wall, then another, then another-until they burst into open air again. Hulk lifts him overhead and slams him down so hard the street caves in.

Abomination coughs-then laughs again.

"YES!"

He hooks Hulk's arm, twists, and **throws him** into a water tower. The structure collapses, flooding the street.

Steam rises.

Hulk emerges-eyes burning brighter.

This time, he doesn't rush.

He **waits**.

Abomination charges again.

Hulk times it.

Sidesteps.

Grabs Abomination's arm.

Spins.

And **throws him into the ground** with such force that the shockwave ripples outward like an earthquake, knocking remaining gamma dogs off their feet.

For a moment-Abomination doesn't move.

Then his hand twitches.

And he pushes himself up.

Still smiling.

From the edge of the battlefield, the X-Men watch.

Storm's winds strain just to keep the debris from spreading.

Jean steadies herself, sweat beading on her brow.

Wolverine sniffs the air, eyes narrowing.

"…Scott," he says into the comm. "You smell that?"

Cyclops turns.

"What?"

"The dogs," Logan says. "They came from somewhere. And whatever made 'em? It ain't here by accident."

Scott hesitates-then nods.

"You track. I'll back you up and follow your lead."

Logan doesn't wait.

He's already moving.

The last gamma dogs fall under coordinated strikes-lightning, optic blasts, precision takedowns.

But none of them step closer to the center.

Because what's happening there-

Isn't a fight anymore.

It's a **reckoning**.

Hulk and Abomination stand facing each other amid the ruins-steam rising, the city holding its breath.

Two paths of power.

Two answers to the same question.

They charge again.

And the world braces.  
The fight drags on.

Hulk is breathing hard now.

Each blow still lands like a hammer-but **Abomination** keeps getting back up. Bones realign. Flesh knits. Every wound closes just fast enough to stay in the fight.

Abomination grins through broken teeth.

"Getting tired?" he snarls. "Good."

He slams Hulk through the side of a building. Hulk rises slower this time. His shoulders heave. His roar comes out rough-strained.

Abomination steps closer, holding Hulks by his neck and lifting in the air.

"You feel it, don't you?" he taunts. "The limit. You hold back. I don't."

He glances toward the hovering chopper in the distance.

"Next, I kill everyone in that thing," he says casually.

"Then I'm going to your little mansion."

Something in Hulk changes.

Not a roar.

Not fury.

**Stillness.**

His posture straightens. His chest expands. Muscle tightens-not explosively, but _densely_. His frame grows-not wild, but deliberate. His feet touches the ground, the ground cracks beneath his feet.

Resolve replaces rage.

Abomination's grin falters.

"…What did you just do?"

Hulk grabs his hand and pulls it away.

And moves.

Before Abomination can react, Hulk is already there-too fast, too heavy. A punch caves Abomination's chest inward. Another snaps his jaw sideways. A third drives him into the street so hard the pavement buckles like clay.

Abomination swings back-

It does nothing.

Hulk doesn't flinch.

He grabs Abomination's arm and **breaks it**-the sound sharp, final. Healing tries to catch up, but Hulk doesn't give it time.

He locks Abomination down, shifting his weight, using leverage-**control**. Hulk wraps his forearm around Abomination's neck, tightening slowly, deliberately, holding the broken arm with his legs.

Abomination struggles. His strength bleeds away. His healing slows.

Bones crack under pressure.

The street goes quiet except for Hulk's breathing.

Abomination's movements weaken.

Then stop.

Hulk holds him there-too long.

He could finish it.

Instead-he releases.

Abomination collapses, unmoving.

Hulk steps back.

There is no triumph in his eyes.

Only exhaustion.

Regret.

"I didn't choose this," Hulk mutters. "I chose… to protect."

A soft voice reaches him.

"Bruce."

**Betty Ross** stands a few steps away, fear and awe mixed as she looks at him-really looks at him-for the first time like this.

Hulk turns gently.

"I told you," he says quietly. "Everything's okay."

The X-Men approach cautiously. They check Abomination-no movement. No breath.

Finished.

**General Thaddeus Ross** steps forward, staring at the body. His voice is low.

"I'm disappointed," he says.

Betty stiffens.

"In myself," Ross continues. He looks at Hulk.

"Take her. Go."

Betty turns.

"Dad-?"

Ross raises his voice.

"LEAVE."

Hulk doesn't hesitate.

He lifts Betty carefully, cradling her like something precious, and steps back.

With one powerful leap, they vanish into the distance.

Ross turns toward his chopper.

Then a voice stops him.

"Hold up, General."

Ross turns.

**Logan** stands beside **Cyclops**.

Between them-bound, silent, furious-

the Mystery Man.

Logan smirks.

"Got a little surprise for you."

Ross stares.

And realizes-

The war he thought he was fighting

was never the real one.

---

## Chapter 6

The room is sterile.

Concrete walls. A single table. A reinforced glass pane humming faintly with containment fields. On one side, **Bruce Banner** stands with his hands at his sides. Beside him, **General Thaddeus Ross** watches silently.

On the other side of the glass-

A man sits, restrained, smiling.

"Hello, Bruce."

Bruce doesn't answer.

He just stares.

"Did you really think it was anyone else?" the man continues, amused. "After all this time?"

Ross shifts uncomfortably.

Bruce exhales.

"…Dad?"

**Brian Banner** leans forward.

"I was trying to build something without weakness that day," Brian says. "Something that could survive anything. And instead, I got a monster who wants to _hide_. Who doesn't even want to be the strongest."

Bruce's jaw tightens.

"I tipped off the Army," Brian continues casually. "That little cure attempt of yours? I couldn't let you erase perfection just because you're afraid of it."

Bruce says nothing.

For the first time, Brian's smile falters.

"I gave you everything," Brian snaps. "And you throw it away. You dissapoint me."

Bruce finally speaks.

"I'm glad," he says quietly. "I'm glad I'm a disappointment to you."

Brian stiffens.

"Because here I am," Bruce continues, voice steady, "choosing who I want to be. Despite everything you did. Despite what you tried to turn me into."

He steps closer to the glass.

"You may be my father," Bruce says. "But you don't have any right over me."

A pause.

"You'll never see me again. You'll never see the light of the day."

Brian surges forward, rage breaking through.

"How _dare_ you speak to me like that-"

Bruce turns away.

Brian's voice fades into incoherent shouting as Bruce walks out.

Outside, the air feels different.

Ross stands beside him for a moment.

"I'm done chasing you," Ross says at last. "You don't have to worry about Blonsky, he is under our containment. But be careful. There are others. People who want what you can do."

Bruce, "I will".

As he turns to leave, Ross adds, quieter-

"Also tell Betty… I love her. And I miss her."

Bruce nods.

A car waits-sent by **Charles Xavier**.

Back at the mansion, Charles meets Bruce in his study.

He hands him a folder with the title **HERO ACT**.

Bruce opens it, confused.

"What is this?"

"Your registration," Charles says. "Once you sign, you're protected. Recognized. You won't be hunted anymore."

A gentle smile.

"You're a hero now."

Bruce's eyes fill.

He laughs softly, almost disbelieving.

"I never thought anyone would call me that."

Charles watches him carefully.

"What will you do now?" he asks.

Bruce thinks.

"I'll go back," he says. "Live with Betty. Apply for a professor role. Try to have… a normal life."

Charles nods.

"Anywhere in mind?"

"Virginia," Bruce replies. "That's where she works."

Charles smiles.

"A good city."

Bruce walks the grounds one last time.

The X-Men nod as he passes. Children wave. Some smile. Some just watch-knowing they're looking at someone who chose restraint when power begged for more.

Bruce raises a hand in farewell.

At the gate, **Betty Ross** waits by her car.

He gets in.

They drive away.

No sirens.

No pursuit.

Just a road forward.

For the first time-

Bruce Banner chooses his life.

And the world lets him.
