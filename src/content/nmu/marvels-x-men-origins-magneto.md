## Description

Location: Central Europe, between Poland and Germany, touching the Baltic Sea.  
Inspiration: East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia after WWII.

Background:

- Once part of Nazi-occupied Europe; divided by the Iron Curtain after the war.
- In the 1970s, it's under an authoritarian "reconstruction" regime that preaches unity while quietly discriminating against Jewish families, Roma people, and refugees.
- There is economic depression, industrial decay, and paranoia about "traitors" and "foreign loyalties."
- The Jewish community mostly lives in old ghettos turned into working-class quarters.
- The government allows synagogues to exist but spies on rabbis and restricts Jewish business licenses.
- Locals casually use antisemitic slang - not violent mobs, but an everyday, cutting humiliation.

## Chapter 1: Dark Past

_Childhood: Vornavia_

Erik Magnus Lehnsherr was a gifted boy born to a lower-class Jewish family in the heart of **Vornavia**, a cold industrial nation still nursing its wounds from the war. It was the early 1970s, but in Vornavia, time felt trapped between eras - the ruins of old battles standing beside the walls of new factories.

Erik lived with his father, mother, and elder sister in a cramped ghetto apartment. His sister worked long hours at small jobs so they could afford Erik's education - their one fragile hope for a better life. But Erik despised school. Not because he lacked curiosity, but because every day there felt like a punishment. His classmates mocked him for his name, his accent, his faith. Even the teachers seemed to carry quiet contempt in their eyes, always finding a reason to humiliate him - a wrong answer, a late paper, a missing uniform button.

When he complained, his father would place a hand on his shoulder and say:

"Listen, Erik... people are misguided. They don't know what they're doing. They're still living in the past. But that will change - it must. Don't throw your life away because of their ignorance. Education is the only power a man can claim for himself... and you, my son, have that power."

Erik never argued with him again after that. He would simply nod and join his family for dinner, pretending for a moment that life was normal.

One afternoon, school had just ended. Erik stepped out into the street, clutching his worn bag, when a deafening **explosion** shattered the air.

The world spun. He fell to the ground, dazed, ears ringing. When he lifted his head, everything was chaos - the air thick with dust and fire. Screams. Gunfire. Sirens.

It wasn't war... but it looked like one.  
A group of **Neo-Nazi extremists**, masked and armed, moved through the streets like a swarm, shouting about "purity" and "cleansing." They claimed to be reclaiming the nation from the _lower races_ - words that made no sense to a child yet carried the same venom that haunted his family for generations.

Erik ran - heart pounding, lungs burning - through alleys and broken streets, desperate to reach the ghetto. As he ran, he saw things no child should: neighbors executed in doorways, houses set ablaze, the same banners that once hung in history books now carried again by men who never learned.

By the time he reached home, the block was in ruins. His small apartment was nothing but smoke and rubble. He screamed his family's names as he clawed through the debris with bloodied hands.

And then he saw them.  
His mother and sister - burnt, locked in each other's final embrace.

A sound escaped him - half breath, half scream.

Then, from behind, a voice.  
His father. Alive, staggering, calling his name. But before Erik could reach him, a soldier lifted his rifle and fired.

Erik froze. The world slowed. The echo of the gunshot seemed to stretch forever. His father fell to the ground, lifeless.

Erik dropped down to his knees beside him, trembling. He buried his face against his father's chest, sobbing - desperate, helpless. The smoke stung his eyes, but the pain in his chest burned hotter.

Through his tears, he saw his mother's hand lying just a few feet away, charred but recognizable - the same hand that used to fix his hair every morning before school.

Erik's cries turned into short, broken gasps. His lips quivered. His eyes - once filled with innocence - began to harden.

Footsteps echoed behind him.  
The soldiers were approaching, shouting orders in their native tongue. One of them laughed. Another muttered, "Leave the rat for the camps."

Erik's tears stopped. His breathing slowed. Something shifted in his face - a quiet, deadly stillness.

As the soldiers moved closer, planning to take him, the air began to vibrate.  
Loose nails, bullet casings, bits of metal - they all began to **tremble**.

The ground hummed beneath his feet.  
The soldier shouted, "Kill the boy!"

And then -

A scream tore from Erik's throat, raw and furious.  
A storm of metal erupted outward - bullets twisting midair, knives ripping from belts, rifles bending like paper. The men were thrown, crushed, impaled by the very weapons they carried.

When it ended, silence. Only smoke and corpses.

Erik's body went limp. He collapsed beside his father's remains, his small chest rising and falling in exhaustion, until even that stopped.

The boy who once dreamed of a peaceful life - was gone.

_Lab in a remote island:_

When Erik awoke, he was no longer in Vornavia.  
Cold white lights burned above him, and the sound of waves echoed faintly through the concrete. Through a small barred window he could see an endless horizon of water. Later he would learn this was **Falcon Island**, a secret research base off the coast of Malta. The Vornavian military had handed him over to scientists who studied "genetic abnormalities."

They told him he was _lucky to be alive._  
He did not feel lucky.

For the next five years, Erik lived inside a metal-lined cell no larger than a train compartment. The walls were made of an alloy that blocked magnetic fields; even the air vents were ceramic. Whenever he tried to concentrate, the hum of generators drowned out the faint pulse of metal he could still sense in the world beyond.

The experiments were endless:

- **Neurological mapping.** Electrodes attached to his scalp while currents pulsed through him to measure the brain's reaction.
- **Stress induction.** They flooded his chamber with noise or cold to see when his powers would flare.
- **Isolation trials.** Days without light or human voices, to test the limits of endurance.
- **Cellular sampling.** Needles drawing blood to be compared with normal human DNA.

Each test had the same conclusion: _"Subject E-7 remains unstable."_

Over time, Erik learned to stop screaming. He listened instead-to the tiny clicks inside machines, to the hidden rhythm of magnets in the walls. He began to _understand_ his cage, not just fear it. The pain forged discipline. The loneliness turned to focus.

Among the staff was **Dr. Keller**, the only one who spoke to him kindly. "You're proof of what humanity can become," she said once. "But they'll never let you walk free." Her words stayed with him.

_The Night of Escape_

Five years later, during a violent Mediterranean storm, the facility's power grid failed. The lights flickered, alarms stuttered, and for the first time since his capture, Erik felt the full thrum of the island's metal around him.

He stood still, rainwater leaking through cracks in the ceiling, electricity fading. Then the locks disengaged.

What followed was chaos-screams, the crash of bending steel, corridors collapsing as magnetic waves tore through the complex. By dawn, Falcon Island was silent.

Erik stepped outside into the rain. He was barefoot, soaked in blood, his torn hospital garments clinging to his skin. Lightning flashed over the sea, illuminating the ruins behind him. The rain poured down, washing away the stains of everything that had happened inside.

He looked toward the horizon-the direction of the mainland.  
For a long moment he simply breathed.

The boy who had once begged for his father's life was gone.  
What remained was a man forged in captivity, with the certainty that the world would never again cage him.
