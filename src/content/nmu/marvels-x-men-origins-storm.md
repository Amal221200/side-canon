## Prelude

_"My name is Ororo Munroe._

_My mother, N'Dare, was born into an ancient line of African priestesses, women with white hair, blue eyes, and a rare gift: the ability to wield magic._

_They lived in a hidden village in Kenya. She was meant to be their next leader._

_But my mother chose her own destiny._

_She rebelled. She escaped._

_She wanted knowledge, not prophecy. So she went to university… where she met my father, David Munroe._

_They fell in love. They married. They moved to Harlem, in the United States._

_And they had me._

_My mother was never comfortable there. People looked at us differently. Treated us differently. She didn't want me to grow up in a world where I would always be seen before I was known._

_When I was six months old, my father received a job offer in Cairo. We left Harlem behind and began a new life._

_For a while… we were happy._

_My mother told me stories, about her clan, our lineage, and the women who came before us. She said I carried the same white hair and blue eyes as her grandmother… and that one day, I might inherit the same legendary magic._

_She showed me an ancient ruby, passed down from generation to generation._

_My father told me different stories, about Harlem, about struggle, about love, and about choosing hope even when the world makes it difficult._

_Everything changed when I was six years old._

_A plane crash destroyed our home._

_My parents were killed._

_I survived… buried beneath the rubble, trapped beside their bodies._

_That day never left me._

_It followed me like a ghost, returning every time the walls closed in, every time the air felt stolen._

_I escaped eventually._

_With nothing but the clothes on my back…_

_And my mother's ancestral ruby._

_"_

## CHAPTER 1: SURVIVAL

Ororo did not remember being found.

She remembered **hunger** first, the way it hollowed her stomach until the ache felt sharper than grief. She remembered heat pressing down on her skin, the city's breath thick with dust and sweat and rot. She remembered learning, very quickly, that no one looked twice at a barefoot child unless she was already dead.

The boys who noticed her were older, sharper, already half-broken by the streets. They watched her for a full day before approaching. When they did, they didn't speak. One of them simply slid a piece of bread across the stone toward her.

She ate without hesitation.

That was enough.

They led her through alleys too narrow for carts, through passageways that smelled of piss and smoke, to a man who sat beneath a fraying cloth awning like a spider at the center of a web.

Achmed El Gibár did not stand when he saw her.

He studied her silently, the dirt-caked hair, the pale eyes that didn't match her skin, the way her gaze kept drifting upward, searching for open space. When she met his eyes, she didn't look away.

Most children did.

"How long have you been alone?" he asked.

She shrugged.

"How old are you?"

Another shrug.

Achmed nodded, as if she had answered correctly.

"You eat," he said, gesturing behind him. "Then you work."

She followed without question.

Training began the next morning.

Achmed did not explain why things were done, only _how_. He showed her how to stretch out a palm when begging, how to cry without tears, how to vanish into a crowd by becoming unremarkable. He taught her which pockets were loose and which were traps, which locks could be coaxed open and which were meant to maim the impatient.

She learned fast.

Too fast.

At night, she slept on rooftops or near open doorways, anywhere the sky was visible. Walls pressed too close. Enclosed spaces made her chest tighten until breathing felt impossible. When the shaking came, Achmed never spoke.

He only stayed close enough that nothing could reach her.

She was six years old when Achmed sent her after her first real mark.

An American tourist, clean clothes, distracted eyes, heavy wallet. She watched him for nearly an hour, memorizing his movements, his pauses, the rhythm of his steps. When she finally moved, it was with the quiet confidence Achmed had drilled into her.

Her fingers slipped into the pocket.

The world stopped.

Her body locked in place, muscles refusing to obey. It felt as if invisible hands had closed around her mind, not hurting, just _holding_. She tried to pull back, but even that thought felt slowed, muffled.

The man turned.

Their eyes met, and something _else_ touched her, vast, searching, impossibly calm. She didn't understand what was happening, only that she was being _seen_ in a way no one had ever seen her before.

Then another presence crashed into the moment like a blade.

The man staggered, gasping, his expression twisting in sudden agony. Ororo felt the pressure lift just long enough for instinct to take over.

She ran.

She didn't look back until she reached the rooftops, heart pounding so hard she thought it might tear free. Below her, unseen forces clashed, something ancient and cruel pressing against something disciplined and strained.

She did not know their names.

She only knew she had escaped something worse than guards or chains.

From that day on, she avoided the eyes of strangers.

Within a year, Achmed no longer sent anyone to watch her.

She was his best.

The others followed her without question, copying her movements, her timing. She stole because she had to, because food was survival and survival was everything. There was no romance in it, no thrill, only necessity sharpened into skill.

But necessity grew dull.

She wanted harder targets. Cleaner victories. Proof that she was more than just another child scraping by.

That was how she heard about the mansion.

Guards. Myths. Whispers of something ancient and valuable hidden behind walls too confident to fear thieves.

She went alone.

The locks yielded more easily than she expected. The halls were silent in a way that felt wrong, but she ignored it. She found the ruby in a velvet-lined case, warm when she touched it, almost pulsing, as if it were alive.

The moment she lifted it free, the world screamed

The explosion came without warning. Stone shattered. Fire roared through corridors that had been silent seconds before. Ororo ran, not thinking, not questioning, diving through smoke and flame as the mansion collapsed behind her.

She did not stop running until her lungs burned.

She did not think about the people inside.

She returned to Achmed grinning, breathless, holding the ruby out like a trophy.

For the first time since she had known him, Achmed's face changed.

Not anger.

Fear.

"What did you take?" he asked quietly.

She told him.

He took the ruby from her hands at once, closing his fingers around it as if afraid it might escape. His jaw tightened.

"This," he said, "was not meant to be stolen."

She waited for praise that never came.

Instead, he locked the ruby away and said no more.

That night, Ororo lay awake under the open sky, confused by the strange emptiness in her chest, the feeling that she had crossed a line she didn't know existed.

Neither of them knew the truth.

That the mansion had belonged to something that did not die easily.

That the ruby was not treasure at all, but a heart.

Ororo learned, slowly and unwillingly, how to be angry.

Grief had come first, heavy, suffocating, impossible to look at directly. Anger was lighter. Sharper. Easier to carry.

If her parents had stayed, she told herself, they would not have died. If they had not moved. If they had not chosen a life that left her alone beneath stone and fire.

She stopped saying their names.

She stopped saying her own.

The other children called her **Snow-top**, laughing at the way her hair caught the sun, at the strangeness of her eyes. She let the name settle over her like a second skin. Snow melted. Snow disappeared. Snow was not buried beneath rubble.

Ororo became someone else.

Someone who did not wait for anyone to come back.

When Achmed sent her to the museum alone, she did not ask why.

She had been waiting for this.

The building loomed over the square like a challenge, guards moving in lazy, predictable patterns. She studied them from a rooftop, counting steps, memorizing shadows. Her hands were steady. Her breath slow.

This was what she was good at.

The window yielded to her touch. The halls smelled of dust and old stone, the silence thick but not threatening. She moved through it like water, barely disturbing the air.

The box was smaller than she expected.

Unremarkable.

She slipped it free, retraced her steps, and vanished back into the night without a sound.

When she returned, Achmed was waiting.

She placed the box at his feet and knelt, unable to hide her pride. This was her moment, proof that she could be trusted, that she was no longer just surviving but _becoming_.

Achmed did not open it right away.

When he finally did, the alley seemed to shrink around them.

Inside was a photograph.

Her parents.

Younger than she remembered them. Smiling. Alive in a way that felt impossible.

The air left her lungs.

Her knees hit the ground before she realized she was falling. The anger she had wrapped herself in split apart, and everything she had buried rushed back in, the sound of laughter she barely remembered, the warmth of hands she could no longer feel.

Achmed watched her in silence.

At last, he spoke.

"A great thief hides from others," he said, his voice low and even.

"But never from herself."

She shook her head violently, tears burning her eyes.

"That name isn't mine," she said. "It belongs to people who left."

For a moment, Achmed said nothing. Then he closed the box and pushed it gently toward her.

"Running from who you are," he said, "is the easiest way to be caught."

She did not answer.

That night, she climbed to the highest rooftop she could find and cried until her chest hurt. She cried for the parents she hated, and for the child who had waited for them to come back anyway.

In the days that followed, she said her name only in her head. Quietly. Carefully. As if testing whether it would break her again.

Ororo.

When she finally spoke it aloud, the sound felt strange, painful, but real.

She returned to Achmed and bowed her head.

"Thank you," she said.

He nodded once, as if that was all he had been waiting for.

By the time Ororo turned ten, Achmed stopped watching her hands.

He watched her **choices**.

That was how she knew she had been noticed.

Hakiim and Nari fell in behind her without argument the first night Achmed sent them out together. She didn't correct them. Leadership, she had learned, was not something you claimed. It was something others surrendered when they trusted you not to disappear.

They moved through the city with the practiced ease of children who knew every shortcut and shadow. The target was simple, sacks of grain, crates of dried fruit. Food for mouths that would not eat otherwise.

They were almost clear when Hakiim stumbled.

The sound was small. Barely anything.

It was enough.

A guard's shout tore through the night.

Ororo's pulse spiked. She turned, already calculating, distance, numbers, escape routes. Nari didn't hesitate. She grabbed her sack and ran, feet light, fast, vanishing into the dark.

"Food first," Nari hissed over her shoulder. "They'll catch you both."

Ororo didn't answer.

Hakiim froze, eyes wide, hands shaking as guards closed in. Ororo darted back, grabbing his arm, pulling him toward a narrow gap between buildings. One of the guards lunged, fingers catching cloth. She kicked, hard, felt the jolt up her leg.

It wasn't enough.

They were children. The guards were not.

Steel flashed. Hands closed around her shoulder, rough and unyielding. Hakiim screamed.

Then the night broke open.

Achmed appeared out of the shadows like something summoned, his voice sharp, his movements precise. The guards fell back under his fury, under the weight of experience they did not expect from a man they had never noticed before.

He took them home without a word.

Nari talked the moment they were safe.

She laughed, breathless, showing off the food like trophies. "Did you see how fast I moved?" she said. "They never even came close."

Ororo stood apart, heart still racing, Hakiim's shaking not yet faded from her bones.

Achmed listened.

Then he turned.

Nari's smile faltered when his hand struck.

She cried out, stunned more than hurt.

"You abandoned your own," Achmed said, his voice flat. "Food feeds bodies. Loyalty keeps them alive."

He turned next to Hakiim.

"This is not the first time you've stumbled," he said. "Carelessness costs others."

Hakiim lowered his head, waiting.

"No," Ororo said.

The word came out before she thought.

They all turned to her.

"I was leading," she said, forcing her voice to stay steady. "If he fell, it was because I pushed too hard. If she ran, it's because I didn't make the rules clear."

Achmed studied her for a long moment.

Then he nodded.

"You understand," he said.

He punished her instead.

The blows burned, but Ororo did not cry. Pain was familiar. Responsibility was new, heavier, sharper, harder to carry.

That night, as she lay bruised beneath the open sky, Ororo understood something she would never forget:

Leadership did not mean being the best.

It meant staying when it would have been easier to run.

The job came wrapped in whispers.

Achmed did not speak the client's name aloud at first. When he finally did, the alley seemed to listen.

Desmond Barrett.

A man who paid well, asked little, and never took responsibility for what followed. He spoke of an artifact older than empires, the **Opal of Ozymandias**, a thing said to bind its bearer to an ancient power, to strip them of death and leave only obedience to an ancient mutant Apocalypse.

Achmed did not believe in legends.

He believed in weight, guards, traps, and exits.

And the pyramids had all four.

They entered before dawn, when the desert still held its breath.

Stone swallowed sound. Each step echoed too loudly, too clearly, as if the walls themselves were counting them. Ororo moved first, hand raised when she felt something wrong, a floor tile worn too smooth, a corridor that smelled too clean.

They worked together the way Achmed had taught them to.

Nari darted ahead, quick and precise.

Hakiim checked the walls, careful where he placed his hands.

Ororo watched everything, shadows, air, silence.

Traps revealed themselves slowly: pressure plates disguised as sand, blades that whispered down from ceilings, corridors that narrowed just enough to panic the careless. They bypassed each one, breath held, sweat cooling on skin.

When they reached the chamber, the air changed.

Stone statues lined the walls, warriors, priests, kings, all frozen mid-motion, eyes carved too carefully to be dead. At the center stood one figure taller than the rest, arms outstretched, holding the Opal.

It glowed faintly.

Nari stepped forward without waiting.

Her fingers closed around the gem.

The statues moved.

Stone screamed as it tore itself free, joints grinding, weapons lifting. The room filled with thunder as ancient guardians advanced.

They ran.

They fought.

They failed.

Then everything stopped.

The tallest statue lowered its weapon.

It turned, not toward the others, but toward Ororo.

And bowed.

The sound of stone kneeling echoed through the chamber.

"I am sorry," the statue said, voice like rock grinding against time itself.

Ororo froze.

The others stared, unable to speak.

"I have waited," Ozymandias continued, eyes fixed on her. "I see what was. I see what will be."

He gestured, and the walls shimmered with carvings she hadn't noticed before, images etched deep into stone. A woman standing beneath storm-wracked skies. Winds bending to her will. People kneeling, not in fear, but in need.

"You will not remain this," he said gently. "You will rise. You will command the air. You will save your people."

Ororo's throat tightened.

She didn't want destiny.

She wanted out.

Ozymandias placed the Opal in her hands. It was heavy, cold, wrong.

"Go," he said. "Your path lies beyond this place."

They ran.

The explosion came without warning.

The ceiling collapsed in a roar of stone and dust. Ororo felt herself thrown forward, the world slamming shut around her.

Darkness.

Pressure.

No air.

Hakiim screamed her name, then choked it off.

Nari managed to escape with the Opal, wanting to find Achmed to help, but she got captured by Barrett. He took her, including Achmed, and fled the place, leaving the trapped kids to die.

The pyramid closed around them the way Cairo had years ago.

Her parents died here.

Not again.

Her chest seized. Panic clawed up her throat. The dark pressed closer, crushing thought, crushing breath.

She was six years old again.

Buried.

Waiting.

Afraid.

Then, something broke.

The air moved.

At first, just a whisper, a shift where no wind should exist. Then stronger, tearing through dust and debris, carving space where there had been none. Lightning followed, sudden and blinding, cracking stone like fragile bone.

The rubble exploded outward.

Ororo gasped, sucking in air as if for the first time in her life. Hakiim lay beside her, stunned but alive.

The sky stared down at her through the ruin.

She stared back.

They found Barrett where Achmed was being held, bound, bruised, surrounded by children meant for sacrifice.

The fight was chaos. Screams. Fire. Panic.

Ororo remembered Ozymandias's warning.

She held out the Opal.

"Activate it," she told Barrett, voice steady. "This is what you wanted."

Greed blinded him.

The stone took him instantly.

His body froze mid-breath, flesh turning to rock, eyes wide and unseeing, immortal, invincible, forever trapped.

The legends had been true.

When it was over, Ororo stood among the freed children, hands shaking.

She had seen the future.

She had touched power.

And for the first time, she understood something Achmed had never said aloud:

Survival was not the same as destiny.

And destiny was far more dangerous.

Two years later, restlessness came without warning.

It settled into Ororo's bones like an ache that refused to be named. Cairo no longer held her the way it once had. The rooftops felt lower. The alleys are narrower. Even the sky above the city seemed crowded, pressed thin by smoke and stone.

She found herself watching the river.

The Nile moved with purpose, steady, patient, unconcerned with borders or cities or the lives clinging to its banks. It did not hesitate. It did not look back.

Neither would she.

Achmed noticed before she spoke.

He always did.

"You're leaving," he said one evening, not as a question.

She nodded.

He did not argue. He did not ask how long. Some people passed through your life like seasons, and Achmed had always known she was one of them.

Before dawn, he pressed the **Heart of Eternal Darkness** into her hands.

"For the road," he said.

She looked at it, remembering fire and stone and prophecy, remembering how close power felt to ruin. "I don't want this," she said.

"You don't want many things that will save you," Achmed replied.

She hugged him, longer this time. He stood stiff at first, then rested his hand briefly against her back, as if committing the moment to memory.

Then she walked south.

The Nile carried her out of Egypt like a guide who asked nothing in return.

She followed its curve through heat and dust, through towns that barely noticed her and villages that watched her with careful eyes. She traded small kindnesses for food, slept beneath open sky, listened more than she spoke.

In some places, rain followed her without reason.

In others, crops bent toward her as if recognizing something they could not name.

She did not stay long enough to ask why.

Khartoum passed beneath her feet like a turning page. Ethiopia rose ahead, green and vast and unfamiliar. The farther she walked, the lighter her chest felt, as if distance itself were teaching her how to breathe again.

The man seemed kind.

That was what frightened her most, afterward, how easily she had believed it.

He offered her a ride when the road grew long and the sun burned too hot. He spoke softly, smiled easily, asked nothing of her except where she was headed.

She climbed in.

The change came slowly. A hand lingering too long. A voice lowering. Space shrinking.

Her chest tightened.

The sky felt far away.

When she told him to stop, he laughed.

When she tried to move, he grabbed her.

Fear cut through her like lightning, sharp, blinding, absolute. There was no time to think. No space to run.

She fought.

Instinct took over, raw and unshaped. Her hands found something solid. Her strength came from somewhere deeper than muscle, deeper than thought.

When it was over, the man lay still.

Too still.

She stared at him, breath tearing in and out of her lungs, waiting for him to move.

He didn't.

The silence that followed was heavier than the heat.

She stumbled away from the road and retched until there was nothing left in her body but shaking and grief. Her hands would not stop trembling. She scrubbed them in dirt, then in water, then in dirt again, as if she could erase what she had done.

What she had been forced to do.

Under the open sky, she sank to her knees.

"I won't do this again," she whispered, not to him, not to anyone else, but to herself. "Never again."

She stayed there until the stars came out, until her breathing slowed, until the vow settled into her bones.

From that day on, Ororo Munroe carried a line inside her she would not cross again.

No matter the cost.

---

## CHAPTER 2: WIND RIDER

Ororo did not mean to return home.

The land did it to her.

After months of walking south, following rivers and roads without asking where they led, the air began to change. It grew wider. Lighter. The sky stretched farther here, unbroken by cities or stones. When she crossed into Kenya, something inside her loosened, as if the ground itself recognized her.

She stayed.

The thieves found her first.

They always did it.

This group was different, less desperate, more careful. Their teacher was older, slower, and kinder in the way men became when they had already buried too many children. He knew Achmed. Spoke his name with quiet respect. He did not ask Ororo where she had come from or why she never slept indoors.

He only asked if she could work.

She could.

Her powers did not announce themselves at first.

They crept in.

A misstep corrected by a sudden gust. A leap that should have fallen short, carried instead by unseen hands. Wind brushing past her face when no breeze stirred the grass.

Each time it happened, fear followed.

She wanted to be normal.

Normal meant quiet hands. Normal meant nothing answering when she panicked. She stole a wig from a market stall and wore it even in the heat, hiding the white hair that drew too many eyes. When the wind came unbidden, she pressed herself flat against the earth and waited for it to stop.

She told no one.

She stole less now. Only what she needed. Food. Cloth. Small things that reminded her of her parents, a scrap of film, a cracked lens, anything that suggested a future that wasn't just survival.

Hope, stolen carefully, was still hope.

Ororo noticed Claude de Ruyter because of a camera.

It hung from his neck like a memory she hadn't allowed herself to touch in years. Her father's hands had held something like that once. Her father had seen the world through glass and light and patience.

She took it without thinking.

The gunshots came seconds later.

Claude shouted. His men raised weapons. Ororo ran, heart hammering, lungs burning, but the alley narrowed too fast. Fear surged, sharp and familiar.

The wind answered.

It rose suddenly, violently, kicking dust into eyes, tearing at balance. The sky darkened as if pulled down by her panic. Lightning cracked so close she felt it in her teeth.

She escaped.

Claude stood frozen in the storm's wake, staring.

He had seen the hair.

He had seen her eyes turn white.

Wind Rider, he thought.

And he smiled.

When she returned to camp, Teacher was waiting.

"You don't steal memories," he told her. "They make you careless."

She bristled. She was better than the others, faster, smarter, more precise. Even better than him.

"That's your problem," he said calmly. "You were taught to survive, not to wait."

Zenja watched from the shadows.

Teacher's daughter. Sharp-eyed. Bitter. She hated the way her father looked at Ororo with something like pride. Hated the way others listened when Ororo spoke.

When Claude came offering coin and promises, Zenja listened.

At first.

Then she listened too closely.

Slaves, Claude said. Betrayal. Black people turning on each other, it spilled from him carelessly, easily.

Zenja felt something twist.

She led them in circles instead.

When they realized, she ran and screamed the warning code until her throat tore open.

They would have died there.

Both of them.

But the trees parted, and a man stepped into the clearing who carried himself like the land belonged to him.

He moved quickly. Decisively. Claude's men fell back without understanding why.

Later, when the danger had passed, the children stared.

Prince of Wakanda, they whispered.

Girls laughed too loudly. Boys bowed too deeply.

Ororo did neither.

"You are not the king of me," she told him coolly. "You don't rule Ororo Munroe."

He laughed, surprised, delighted.

"Then you are a white lioness," he said. "Untamed."

They left together.

The days that followed felt unreal.

They walked, talked, argued. He spoke of duty; she spoke of freedom. At night, the stars stretched endlessly above them, and the world felt briefly gentle.

They fell in love the way young people did-quickly, fiercely, believing it might last because they wanted it to.

They shared a night beneath the open sky.

She slept without fear.

Claude de Ruyter did not grieve.

He planned.

He sent word north, then farther still, until his brother answered. Andreas arrived with men who did not ask questions and weapons that ended them. Together, they followed the trail Claude knew Ororo would leave behind, kindnesses remembered, villages spoken of too fondly.

They reached the camp at dawn.

There was no warning. No chance to run.

The children died where they slept. The Teacher tried to stand between them and the blades, old body trembling, voice raised not in fear but anger.

It bought nothing.

When the killing stopped, Zenja sat alone in the dirt, blood drying on her hands that had never held a weapon. Claude crouched in front of her and smiled as if she were a clever animal.

"Where is she?" he asked.

Zenja told him.

Ororo did not hear them coming.

The first blow took her from behind. The second stole her breath. When she woke, the world was iron and darkness.

The coffin closed with a sound that broke something inside her.

It was too narrow. Too precise. Metal pressed against her shoulders, her knees, her chest. There was barely room to breathe. The air tasted stale, recycled, dead.

Her heart began to race.

No sky.

No wind.

No space.

She clawed at the walls until her fingers bled. Memories surged unbidden - stone collapsing, her parents' hands inches away, the crushing certainty that this was how it ended.

The coffin hummed softly, suppressing something inside her, holding the storm down.

She screamed until her throat gave out.

When the lid finally opened, light burned her eyes.

Zenja stood there, shaking.

"They're dead," Zenja said. "All of them. Because of you."

Ororo tried to speak, but the words tangled with panic. Zenja raised a blade.

"You left," she said. "You got to live."

The walls closed in again.

Ororo didn't remember calling the lightning.

It came anyway.

The sound was brief. Final.

Zenja fell.

Silence rushed in, thick and unbearable.

Andreas didn't flinch.

He stepped forward calmly, as if studying a machine he had long ago learned to dismantle. When Ororo tried to strike him, the lightning shattered harmlessly against a field she could not see.

He smiled.

"Impressive," he said.

Then he took her.

Again.

T'Challa surrendered without hesitation.

They chained him beside her in the helicopter, metal biting into wrists that had fought armies. The blades spun faster. The ground fell away.

Ororo's breathing slowed.

Fear sharpened into focus.

She worked the lock with numb fingers, feeling the wind shift, responding this time not to panic but resolve. The chain fell free.

Andreas lunged.

The helicopter lurched violently as they fought, metal screaming under strain. A sudden tilt. Weightlessness.

Then the sky opened.

Andreas and T'Challa fell.

Ororo didn't think.

She jumped.

The air caught her like an old friend. Wind roared, answering need with force. Lightning split the sky, striking Andreas mid-fall, tearing him from the air like a broken thing.

Ororo held herself and T'Challa aloft on instinct and will, arms trembling as the ground rushed up to meet them.

They landed hard, alive.

Behind them, the helicopter spiraled down, exploding into fire that tore through the village.

Ororo raised her hands.

Rain fell.

Hard. Fast. Unrelenting.

The flames died.

The people stared.

"Are you a god?" someone asked, voice barely louder than the rain.

Ororo said nothing.

They traveled together after that.

Not as before.

When they found Klaw, when T'Challa saw the man who killed thousands of innocent Wakandans, something inside him shifted, sharp and irreversible.

"I stayed too long," he said that night. "I have duties I cannot outrun."

Ororo heard the truth beneath the words.

She was not part of that future.

"You choose a throne over us," she said, anger burning hot and raw. "After everything."

"I choose responsibility," he replied. "You should understand that."

She laughed, bitter. "I chose freedom. And it cost me everyone."

They said things they could not take back.

He left.

Ororo stood alone beneath a sky that no longer felt endless, only empty.

The wind moved around her, waiting.

She did not answer it yet.

---

## CHAPTER 3: GODHOOD

Ororo stopped counting the days.

Time lost its shape once people began waiting for her.

She moved across the continent like a rumor made flesh, through villages with cracked earth and hollow-eyed children, through lands where storms no longer came when they were needed. Wherever she stayed, the sky responded. Rain fell. Winds shifted. Rivers remembered how to flow.

At first, she helped because she could.

Later, because she was asked.

Eventually, because she was expected.

She met the Maasai in the Serengeti Plains in Tanzania, where the grass bent endlessly beneath a sky too vast to belong to any one person. They did not run from her. They did not raise weapons. They knelt.

"We have seen you," they told her calmly. "In dreams. In the wind."

They called her **Goddess Ororo**.

The name sat wrong in her chest.

She laughed at first, uneasy, dismissive but no one laughed with her. They spoke of drought breaking, of storms walking beside a woman with white hair and eyes like the heart of lightning.

She tried to explain.

They listened politely.

Then they waited.

So she stayed.

Uzuri was small, close to the border where Kenya bled into Tanzania. The land there was tired, worn thin by seasons that had stopped caring. An old woman named **Ainet** took Ororo in without ceremony, offering her water, a place near the fire, and silence.

Ainet asked no questions.

She watched.

When the rains came at Ororo's whispered request, the village celebrated for days. Children danced barefoot in mud. Elders wept openly. Hands reached for Ororo, not to touch, but to reassure themselves she was real.

For the first time since Cairo, Ororo felt something close to peace.

The drought returned months later, harder than before.

This time, Ororo did not hesitate.

She stood beneath the open sky and **commanded** it.

Rain fell for days.

Not gentle rain. Not patient rain. But relentless, overflowing, drenching the land until the earth could hold no more. Uzuri thrived. Fields bloomed green. Wells filled.

Far beyond the village, the sky emptied itself.

The balance broke.

Animals collapsed where water never came. Other villages watched clouds pass overhead without relief. Hunger followed. Then death.

Ororo felt it before she saw it the tension in the wind, the way the air no longer moved naturally around her.

Ainet came to her quietly.

"You forced the sky," the old woman said.

"I saved them," Ororo replied, her voice brittle.

Ainet shook her head. "You saved _us_."

She led Ororo beyond the village, to where the land lay cracked and lifeless.

"Rain is not mercy when it is stolen," Ainet said. "It is theft."

The words cut deeper than any accusation.

Ainet taught her to listen.

Not to prayers.

Not to praise.

To **patterns**.

To the way heat gathered. To how animals moved before storms. To how the land asked without words. Rain was not meant to obey it was meant to **answer**.

Ororo learned to release what she had taken, to guide the storms gently, to give back what she had unbalanced. It took weeks. Some damage could not be undone.

She did not sleep much during that time.

When the people called her goddess again, she no longer answered.

She watched them bow and felt something tighten inside her chest. Worship had made her powerful but it had also made her careless.

She thought of the man she had killed.

Of the children who had died while she lived.

Of the sky answering fear before wisdom.

Gods did not doubt.

She did.

At night, she stood alone beneath the stars and wondered what would happen when the people realized she was not divine, only dangerous if misunderstood.

The wind moved around her, waiting.

For the first time, Ororo did not tell it what to do.

The villagers built the dam by hand.

Stone by stone, mud-packed and imperfect, stretching across a riverbed that had forgotten what water felt like. They worked without complaint, because Ororo had promised rain and promises from gods were not questioned.

She stood apart when it was finished, watching the sun burn the earth pale and brittle. The sky above felt tense, like breath held too long.

She reached for it carefully.

Clouds gathered. Slowly. Responsibly. She guided them the way Ainet had taught her, coaxing, not commanding.

Then something _pulled back_.

The wind twisted sharply, dragged away from her control, folding into itself with violent intent. The storm grew too fast, too wide, its edges hardening into something unnatural.

Ororo staggered.

This was not her doing.

A figure emerged within the clouds, laughing, exultant, arms raised as if the world itself were a toy.

Deluge.

He drank from the storm greedily, amplifying it beyond balance, beyond mercy. The sky darkened in every direction. Lightning multiplied, striking without rhythm or restraint.

Ororo fought for control and found none.

And then she heard the scream of engines.

The aircraft tore through the storm like a wounded animal.

Metal shrieked. Fire flared. Then the sound vanished into thunder as the plane vanished from sight.

Ororo didn't think.

She ran into the rain as if it might part for her. The wind fought back, furious and disobedient, but she forced her way through it until she found wreckage scattered across the land.

A blue-furred body lay broken among the debris.

Alive.

Barely.

She carried him the way she had once carried grain, the way she had once been carried herself, careful, reverent, refusing to let him die simply because the world had decided he should.

The village watched in uneasy silence as she laid the stranger down.

He was unlike anyone they had seen, brilliant eyes behind broken glasses, body twisted by pain, breath shallow but steady. Even unconscious, there was something alert about him, as if his mind refused to rest. Ororo knelt beside him, one hand raised, holding the storm at bay with sheer will until dawn crept slowly into the sky.

She did not leave his side.

The others arrived with the morning.

First, a man with burning eyes held behind red glass. He stopped short when he saw her, uncertainty flickering across his face.

Then a woman stepped forward; calm, focused; her presence brushing against Ororo's thoughts like a hand near fire, careful not to touch.

They were young. Not children. Not elders.

Equals.

They did not bow.

They did not kneel.

They asked questions.

"Is he alive?" the man with the visor asked.

Ororo hesitated; she answered in her native language, "Who are you?"

She sensed Hank's presence, relieved knowing his status. "Thank you for saving our friend" she said gently.

Ororo felt it then not intrusion, not force, just **attention**.

_"May I?"_ The woman's intent asked.

Ororo studied her for a long moment, then inclined her head.

"Yes," she said. "But… gently."

Jean helped Ororo remember English, now she can speak and understand it, she introduced her with everyone and she learns her names

A few hours later, they moved away from the village as the sky darkened again, not naturally. Ororo felt the pressure shift, the wind tightening in on itself.

"Deluge," Scott said, jaw tight. "He feeds energy. Storms, pressure systems, anything he can amplify."

Ororo's gaze snapped at him. "He steals the sky."

"Yes," Hank said as he joined them, adjusting his cracked glasses. "And if he keeps drawing from it, the imbalance could spread far beyond this region."

The words _imbalance_ and _spread_ needed no translation.

Ororo closed her eyes, feeling the air respond to her unease. "I can stop the storm," she said.

Jean shook her head. "Not without him taking it back."

Hank crouched, already thinking aloud. "If he's absorbing raw energy… then we don't starve him."

He looked up at Ororo. "We overload him."

She frowned. "How?"

Hank gestured to the clouds. "Water droplets, suspended, precisely shaped."

Jean picked up the thought instantly. "A lens."

Ororo's breath caught.

"Light," she said softly.

Scott stepped forward. "I can take it," he said. "If you can focus it."

Ororo searched for his face; not for confidence, but for _truth_.

She found it.

Deluge came forward.

The storm shifted.

Not rain.

Not wind.

Structure.

Countless droplets hung suspended in perfect alignment, bending sunlight into a single, blinding column in the sky. The effort was immense; every muscle in Ororo's body trembled as she held geometry in motion.

"Now," Jean said quietly, anchoring them together.

Scott braced himself.

Sunlight poured through the lens like fire through glass.

His eyes burned brighter than lightning.

Deluge laughed as the energy surged toward him; arms wide, ecstatic.

"Yes," he roared. "More-!"

Then his laughter cracked.

Too much.

The storm fed him faster than he could contain. His form warped, fissures of light tearing through him as the excess overwhelmed whatever held him together.

The sky detonated.

Silence followed.

When it was over, the clouds thinned naturally, as if relieved.

The strangers prepared to leave.

She did not thank them.

They did not ask her to come with them.

But Hank lingered, studying her with a look she recognized too well.

Curiosity.

"You're like us," he said quietly.

Ororo did not answer.

Later, as the plane lifted safely into clear sky, the woman spoke to the others.

"He already knows," she said.

Far away, Charles felt the wind shift and smiled; not with triumph, but with recognition.

The years blurred.

Ororo no longer measured time by days or seasons, but by the land itself, by how long the earth took to heal after she touched it, by how long people waited before daring to hope again.

She walked where the drought had bitten deepest.

Across the wide breath of the Serengeti, where grass had turned brittle and animals collapsed mid-stride. Through Ngorongoro's vast bowl, where clouds gathered but never broke. Along the edges of Lake Manyara, where water still shimmered but life around it withered. She climbed the slopes of Kilimanjaro, feeling the cold thin air sharpen her focus, listening to storms before they were born.

Wherever she went, she stayed just long enough.

Rain followed her footsteps, sometimes gently, sometimes in long, patient sheets that soaked deep into the ground. Rivers remembered their paths. Crops lifted green heads again. Children learned the sound of thunder without fear.

She did not announce herself.

The people did that for her.

They left offerings where she slept. Sang songs she never taught them. Told stories that changed with each retelling, of a woman who spoke to the sky, of white hair that shone like moonlight, of eyes that turned pale when storms came.

They called her **Wind-Rider**.

They called her **Goddess**.

Ororo never corrected them.

It was easier than explaining balance. Easier than admitting that some rains came too late, that some animals did not rise again, that even she could not undo every loss. Worship simplified grief. It gave suffering a shape that could be knelt before.

So she let them kneel.

Her influence spread outward like weather itself.

Beyond Kenya. Beyond Tanzania. Around the great curve of Lake Victoria, through lands she passed through once and never returned to. Stories traveled where she did not. Long after she had moved on, people still pointed to the sky and spoke her name when clouds gathered.

Children were named after her.

Old women whispered prayers she never heard.

Storms came, and people said she had passed through again.

Ororo felt the weight of it most at night.

She stood alone beneath open skies, listening to wind move through grass and stone, wondering how many lives had been saved and how many depended now on her never leaving.

Gods, she thought, did not get tired.

Gods did not doubt.

But some nights, when the land was quiet and the sky finally obeyed its own rules again, she felt very small beneath it all.

And very alone.

## CHAPTER 4: CHOICE

Xavier waited at the edge of Uzuri.

He did not enter the village.

The people there watched him with suspicion, a stranger in strange clothes, seated in a chair that did not belong on dirt roads. He did not look like a king, a hunter, or a priest. That alone made him dangerous.

Ororo noticed him immediately.

The wind shifted when she approached, not obeying her, just _acknowledging_. She stopped a few paces away and studied him in silence, eyes sharp, posture open but ready.

"You've come a long way," she said.

"So have you," Xavier replied gently.

She didn't smile.

They sat beneath a tree old enough not to care who was divine and who was not.

Xavier spoke first, not of danger, not of destiny, but of memory.

"You were six," he said. "In Cairo."

Her body tensed before her mind caught up.

"You took my wallet," he continued, almost fondly. "Cleanly. Professionally. I would have applauded if I'd been able to move."

She remembered then, the pressure behind her eyes, the sense of being _seen_ without being touched.

"You didn't stop me," she said.

"No," Xavier agreed. "I chose not to."

"Why?"

"Because you were already afraid," he said simply. "And because some truths are not meant for children."

She looked away, toward the sky.

"I am not a goddess," she said flatly, as if daring him to contradict her.

"No," Xavier said. "You are not."

The word landed softly. Relief followed it, sharp, unexpected, painful.

"You are a mutant," he continued. "One of the gifted."

She waited for the rest.

"But that is not why I'm here."

Xavier told her about the others.

About the young man whose eyes carried force he could barely contain. About the woman whose mind brushed against the world with terrifying gentleness. About the brilliant soul trapped in a body, the world refused to understand.

"You met them once," he said. "When the storm was not yours."

She nodded. She had wondered if she would ever see them again.

"They have been taken," Xavier said. "By a tribe not far from here."

Her gaze sharpened.

"They are not like other people," he continued. "They feed on the gifted. They believe power can be consumed, absorbed, inherited."

Ororo felt something cold settle in her chest.

"They are protected," Xavier said quietly. "By something old. Old enough that my mind cannot pass through it. Old enough that I cannot reach my allies. The caves where my students are held are sealed, not by stone, but by belief."

"Magic," Ororo said.

"Something that came before we learned better words," Xavier replied.

She stood.

The wind rose with her, not violently, not eagerly. Waiting.

"You could have come with soldiers," she said. "With weapons."

"I did not come to take," Xavier said. "I came to ask."

She turned back to him, eyes steady.

"You are telling me I am not a god," she said. "And then asking me to act like one."

"No," Xavier said. "I am asking you to act like yourself."

That was the harder thing.

She walked alone that night.

Past the huts. Past the offerings. Past the places where people whispered her name like prayer. The stars stretched endlessly overhead, indifferent to what she chose.

She thought of Cairo.

Of stone and darkness.

Of the man she had killed to survive.

Of rain that had come too late elsewhere because she had chosen _here_.

She thought of the others, young, frightened, caged beneath the earth.

Not worshippers.

Companions.

When she returned, Xavier was still waiting.

"I will help you," she said.

He did not smile.

He bowed his head instead.

And somewhere far away, beneath Kilimanjaro's shadow, the sky began to change.

Jean woke first.

Pain came before thought; chains biting into wrists and ankles, skin rubbed raw by stone. Her head felt heavy, sluggish, as if her thoughts were moving through mud. She tried to reach outward, instinctively, and found only silence.

No spark. No echo.

Nothing.

Scott groaned beside her, straining uselessly against his bonds. Hank lay unnaturally still, breathing shallow and uneven, his body wrong, human again, stripped down to something fragile and breakable.

"They've drugged us," Hank murmured, voice hoarse. "Neural inhibitors. Crude, but effective."

Jean swallowed hard. "I can't feel anything."

That terrified her more than the ropes.

They were dragged from the cave like offerings.

The air outside was thin and cold, the ground uneven beneath their feet. They were forced to sit in a wide, open space ringed with stone and bone, torches flickering in the growing wind. At the center stood a ruby, large, ancient, wrong.

The **Heart of Eternal Darkness**.

High above, clouds thickened unnaturally.

At the mouth of the cave, hidden in shadow, **Charles Xavier** and **Ororo** watched in silence.

The moment Ororo saw the ruby, her breath caught.

That stone.

Fire.

Collapse.

That night, Andreas took everything.

"I lost it," she whispered. "When they took me."

Xavier followed her gaze, understanding settling in his expression. "Then this is worse than we feared."

The tribe gathered, chanting low and rhythmic. Ororo felt the air tighten, twist, something old stirring beneath the earth itself.

"We must destroy it," she said.

"Not yet," Xavier replied. "They're waiting for reaction."

The mountain answered first.

Kilimanjaro groaned.

A deep, terrible sound rolled through the ground. Rocks trembled. The cave walls shuddered violently.

The ritual had begun.

Wind surged outward, wild, and uncontrolled. The mountain was waking up.

Then the rockslide came.

Xavier reacted instantly, pushing Ororo back into the cave just as the entrance collapsed inward.

Stone slammed down.

The force hurled Ororo against the wall.

She screamed.

Xavier lay pinned beneath rubble, blood blooming dark against the stone. His legs did not move.

Ororo crawled toward him, shaking violently.

"No," she whispered. "No, please-"

She reached for the sky instinctively and found nothing.

The cave pressed in.

Stone.

Darkness.

No air.

Her breath hitched.

Not again.

The memories came crashing in, rubble crushing her parents, the coffin snapping shut, her lungs burning as the world closed around her.

Outside, the chanting rose.

Something answered.

The ruby glowed brighter, pulsing, cracking as **Candra** began to form, half-shape, half-shadow, eyes burning with hunger.

"More," the ancient mutant hissed. "More power. More flesh."

The tribe raised their weapons.

Ororo curled inward, hands clutching her head, breath racing out of control.

She was six again.

She was trapped again.

She was about to die again.

Then a voice reached her.

Calm. Steady. Unyielding.

_"Ororo."_

She looked up.

Charles' voice filled her mind, not commanding, but **anchoring**.

_"I know what it is to live with fear. To suffer silently."_

Her breathing slowed, just slightly.

_"I help those who cannot help themselves",_ he continued. "_But I see you. You are not broken. You survived."_

The cave felt less small.

_"Survivors are stronger than their fear,_ he said. _Do not let it cage you. Let it remind you of what you can overcome."_

Images flashed in her mind, villages saved, children laughing in rain, hands lifted in gratitude, fear dissolving when she arrived.

_"You can change the air around this world,_ Charles said. _And we need you now. Help us build a world where people are stronger than fear."_

Her breath steadied.

The panic broke.

Ororo stood.

Lightning flared in her eyes, pure white, blinding.

The air roared.

Stone shattered outward as she tore through the cave entrance with raw force, lifting Xavier from the rubble and setting him safely aside.

She rose into the open sky.

Not as a goddess.

As **Storm**.

The tribesmen faltered, staring upward in terror.

Candra shrieked. "Kill her!"

Ororo moved.

One sweep of wind flattened the attackers, scattering them like leaves. She turned toward the ruby, rage and clarity burning together.

_"You will not play god and take from us anymore."_

Lightning tore from the sky, full force, absolute.

Candra raised her hands, blocking it, screaming in fury. She was not whole yet. Not strong enough.

Ororo did not stop.

She pushed beyond restraint.

Beyond fear.

Beyond what she had ever dared before.

The lightning intensified, splitting the sky, overwhelming Candra's weakening form. With a final, thunderous crack, the **Heart of Eternal Darkness shattered**.

Silence followed.

Then screams.

The chains fell away.

Hank's body twisted painfully as blue fur surged back into place.

Jean gasped as her mind snapped open, power rushing in like breath after drowning. Scott tore free, visor blazing as he scanned for threats.

But the tribesmen were just men now.

No protection.

No power.

They were subdued quickly, efficiently.

Above them, Storm calmed the sky, winds easing, clouds thinning, the mountain settling back into sleep.

The world exhaled.

Later, as the sun broke through thinning clouds, Jean helped Charles onto a stretcher.

His legs remained still.

Ororo knelt beside him, tears streaking her face.

"I'm sorry," she whispered.

Xavier smiled faintly. "No," he said. "This was my choice."

She looked out at the sky, quiet now, obedient again.

Not because she commanded it.

Because she understood it.

The mission was over.

And something new had begun.

Jean was the first to speak.

"You should come with us," she said, not carefully, not rehearsed, just honest. "There are people like us out there who need help. And… we need you."

Ororo looked at her, surprised by how much the words mattered.

Scott nodded, unable to hide the grin that tugged his mouth. "That's right. You were incredible today. We'd be dead if you hadn't shown up. You came like a storm, swept everything away."

She almost laughed at that.

Charles' voice was quieter and warmer. "We meant to ask you years ago," he said. "When my colleagues first met, little one. Circumstances didn't allow it then. But now… we could truly use your help."

Ororo said nothing.

Not yet.

That night, she returned to Uzuri.

The village was quiet, settled into a peace it had not known for years. Ainet sat by the fire, as if she had been waiting all along.

"You're leaving," the old woman said.

Ororo swallowed. "They want me to."

Ainet smiled, not sadly, not proudly, but knowingly. "They are right."

"I can help here," Ororo said. "There is still drought. Still suffering."

"There will always be suffering," Ainet replied gently. "But you were never meant to be the answer to all of it. The sky does not belong to one village."

Tears came then, sudden and unstoppable.

"I'm afraid," Ororo whispered.

"So was I," Ainet said, pulling her into an embrace. "When I realized my children would outgrow me."

Ororo clung to her, sobbing into the folds of her shawl, grieving not just what she was leaving but who she had been.

The next morning, the sky hummed.

A sleek black aircraft descended beyond the village border, stirring dust and wonder in equal measure. The strangers waited.

Then-

"Wait!"

Ororo's voice carried on the wind.

Jean turned first.

She ran to her without hesitation, wrapping Ororo in a fierce, joyful hug. "I knew you'd come," she said, laughing through tears.

Scott offered his hand. "Welcome to the team."

Ororo took it, firm and steady.

Before boarding, she turned one last time.

The people of Uzuri stood together, waving, hands raised-not in worship, but farewell. Pride swelled in her chest, sharp and bittersweet. Tears slipped free again, but she smiled through them.

She stepped inside.

The door closed.

The aircraft lifted.

The world changed again.

The mansion rose from green hills like something both old and hopeful. As Ororo stepped out, she felt the air, different here. Alive with possibility.

Children watched from the school grounds, eyes wide with fascination as she hovered slightly above the grass, without realizing it.

Inside her room waited a uniform.

White. Clean. Purposeful.

**STORM**, stitched into the fabric.

She ran her fingers over it, then put it on.

When she entered the lab with the others, something clicked into place.

Three of them now, Cyclops, Jean, Storm, standing together not as gods or myths, but as equals.

Charles smiled. "Welcome," he said. "You have much to learn."

Ororo met his gaze, calm and certain.

She nodded softly.

Outside, the wind shifted; content, for now.

And for the first time in her life, Ororo Munroe did not belong to the sky alone.

She belonged **somewhere**.
