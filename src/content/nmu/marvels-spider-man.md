## Character description:

Mary Jane Watson: She is a strong, independent, and smart girl with a knack of journalism. She lives in the neighborhood next to Peter's house and has been his friend since childhood. Peter has liked her since the age he even knew what it was, and MJ always liked his company, and has been inseparable. MJ also happens to admire Spider-Man, as she believes he is helping people, and wish to stand up against Bugle.

Harry Osborn: Harry has been Peter's best friend since mid-school. He is a handsome, rich, and incredibly sensible person. He also happens to help Peter to do things he is afraid of, to make him more confident. He also has been introduced to MJ, and they have been together since mid-school. Harry also encourages Peter to tell MJ about his feelings for her, but that's something he hasn't achieved yet.

Gwen Stacy: Gwen Stacy is one of Peter's best friends and his intellectual partner. They met each other in Midtown High as lab partners, and they happen to be the brightest of all. She is the one Peter could talk about science, fiction, and even been able to open to her about deep feelings that most of them are not aware of. She even knows about his feelings for MJ, and she is also aware how much he cares for his friends and his aunt, and it has been rough since he lost his uncle. Peter also happens to get ideas from her about Spidey related stuff without letting her know the truth.

Flash Thompson: Flash Thompson is the quarterback, the potential prom king, and Peter's worst nightmare in school. Flash has been teasing him, beating him, and taking lunch money from him since junior school, at least the amount of bullying has been reduced since Gwen has been defending Peter, and she happens to be the only person in the school Flash actually listens to. Flash comes from a complicated family that no one knows about, and also has an immense respect for Spider-Man. He believes Spidey is the only person who stands against the bad guys and doesn't like mutants as he thinks they only use their powers for their own issue.

May Parker: May Parker is an amazing, strong, and incredibly productive women, who also happens to be like a single guardian to Peter. She does yoga, self-defense, works out, and does multiple jobs to afford Peter's education, and still makes time for household chores, cooking food, and even spending quality time with Peter. She tries not to think about Ben, and focuses on things she can control, that is to be healthy, strong, and be prepared for anything for Peter.

Aleksei Sytsevich: Aleksei Sytsevich is a gangster who happens to have a little beef with Spider-Man. He also created his own Mech Rhino suit from the resources he got from Hammer Head to fight Spidey, but he humiliated Aleksei by defeating him, and putting him behind the bars

Hammer Head: Hammer Head is the crime boss, currently the most notorious criminal in New York, known for smuggling, money laundering, and stealing from others for his own benefit. But Spider-Man has been acting like a thorn in his path, as he ruined multiple operations, causing him more loss than he can imagine. He even brought people like Batroc, Trap-master and even funded Aleksei's Rhino armor, but he constantly fails to put down Spider-Man.

## Prelude:

_"My name is Peter Parker. I'm just a regular high school kid from Queens… who also happens to be your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man._

_It's been a year since that bite - the one from a genetically enhanced spider that changed everything. It gave me the abilities of a spider: wall-crawling, super strength, enhanced senses, agility - and, somehow, the responsibility that comes with them._

_At first, I didn't know what to do with any of it. I used to sneak into underground fights, testing how far my powers could go. One night, after a match, a thief ran past me. I could've stopped him - but I didn't. I thought it wasn't my problem._

_Later that night, my Uncle Ben was murdered by that same thief._

_That was the moment my life changed forever._

_Since then, I've tried to honor his words - "With great power comes great responsibility." I became Spider-Man, fighting for the people who can't fight for themselves, stopping crime, saving lives, and trying every day to live up to the man my uncle wanted me to be._

_In just one year, a lot has happened. I built my own web-shooters, designed a few prototype suits before perfecting one, and took down villains like Batroc, Trapmaster, and even Aleksei Sytsevich in his Rhino armor. But the real problem? The crime lords hiding behind it all - Hammerhead and Tombstone. They control everything from the shadows… and Spider-Man keeps getting in their way._

_I live with my Aunt May - the strongest woman I know. She works two jobs just to afford my education, never once complaining, never once giving up. And somehow, she still finds time to worry about me being late for dinner._

_My friends are my world:_

_Harry Osborn - the confident one who believes in me even when I don't._

_Mary Jane Watson - my childhood friend with dreams bigger than this city._

_Gwen Stacy - my lab partner, sharp as lightning and always two steps ahead._

_And Flash Thompson - the school quarterback who's made it his mission to remind me I'm not cool._

_So yeah… this is my story._

_A high school student, a part-time scientist, and a superhero._

_And this is the story of how I became the first hero of the modern age -_

_The story of Spider-Man."_

## Chapter 1: A Year in Red and Blue

The sirens of Queens cut through the midnight haze, a familiar rhythm that never quite stopped echoing through Peter Parker's nights. Somewhere between the beat of the police radios and the hum of traffic, a streak of red and blue soared across the rooftops - fluid, fast, and impossibly graceful.

Spider-Man.

It had been a year since the bite. A year since that ordinary high-school kid with too much homework and too little confidence had decided to swing into the chaos and make sense of it.

The city didn't know who he was - not really. To some, he was a menace. To others, a myth. But to Peter, he was a promise.

The promise of a man he couldn't bring back.

He landed on a rusted water tower overlooking the East River, chest heaving. Below, a pair of thieves clambered out of a jewelry store window, their bags jangling with glass and silver. Peter sighed, rolling his neck until it popped.

"Guys," he muttered, tightening his gloves, "it's a school night."

He leapt.

The web hit first, followed by the weight of Spider-Man himself - two seconds of acrobatics and one quip later, both thieves were dangling upside down, cocooned against a lamppost. The sirens closed in, and Peter was already gone, swinging through the night, wind howling past his mask.

He didn't wait for thanks. He never did.

Back in his small Queens bedroom, Peter peeled off his mask and stared at his reflection in the mirror - eyes ringed with exhaustion, bruises blooming under his skin, but the faintest smile tugging at his lips. He'd done something tonight. He'd made a difference, even if no one would ever know.

Then his gaze drifted to the old photograph on his desk - Uncle Ben, laughing in the sunlight, hand resting on Peter's shoulder.

Peter whispered, "Still trying, Uncle Ben. Still trying."

## Chapter 2: The Web of Friends

Morning light spilled through the narrow windows of **Midtown High**, catching the dust in golden streaks. The bell rang, sneakers squeaked, lockers slammed. It was chaos with a heartbeat, the kind of noise Peter Parker had learned to love.

He walked through the crowded hallway clutching his half-eaten sandwich and a stack of homework. The bruise near his collarbone pulsed beneath the fabric, a silent reminder of last night's patrol.

"Morning, tiger," said a familiar voice.

Peter looked up and met **Mary Jane Watson's** grin - auburn hair tied back, camera slung around her shoulder, eyes full of that sharp mischief that had followed her since they were kids climbing fences and chasing fireflies.

"You look like you lost a fight with gravity," she teased.

Peter smiled. "More like chemistry homework. Gravity was kinder."

She laughed and nudged his arm. "One day you'll learn to sleep like normal people, Parker."

"Sleep's overrated."

"Tell that to your eye bags."

They turned the corner and found **Harry Osborn** leaning against a locker, phone in hand, school tie undone as usual. "There's my favorite nerd duo," he said, tossing Peter a grin. "MJ, you're looking way too awake for first period."

"That's because I actually sleep," she shot back.

Harry clapped Peter on the shoulder. "Party at my place this weekend. You're coming. No excuses, no homework, no mysterious disappearances. I'm not taking no for an answer."

Peter hesitated. "I'll… try."

"Try means yes," Harry said, flashing that disarming Osborn smile.

From behind them came the unmistakable sound of a football thudding against metal. **Flash Thompson** strutted down the hallway, quarterback confidence radiating off him. He smirked at Peter. "Hey, Parker! Forgot your lunch money again, or you just saving it for a microscope fund?"

MJ rolled her eyes. "Grow up, Flash."

He shrugged. "Just saying hi to my favorite nerd."

Before Peter could respond, a quiet voice cut through the tension. "Ignore him."

**Gwen Stacy** stood by her locker, clutching a stack of science journals. Blonde hair tied neatly, eyes calm but sharp. Flash leaves Peter after she arrives. She handed Peter a small vial wrapped in tissue. "You left this in the lab yesterday. Your formula ratios are off - again."

Peter blinked. "Oh, thanks, Gwen. I, uh, didn't mean to-"

"You never do," she said with a half-smile. "But you're welcome."

Harry watched the exchange and grinned. "So this is the genius lab partner I keep hearing about."

Gwen tilted her head. "And you're the distraction I keep hearing about."

MJ laughed out loud, and Peter just rubbed his neck, smiling despite himself. For a moment, it felt normal - a fragile peace between classes, crushes, and the thousand secrets he carried.

Later, during lunch, the 4 of them gathered at their usual table near the window overlooking the football field. MJ was scribbling notes for the school paper; Gwen was sketching a circuit diagram; Harry was scrolling through his messages, and Flash just finished practicing and having snack at another table.

Peter mostly listened - until he caught MJ glaring at a headline on her laptop:

**DAILY BUGLE: "SPIDER-MENACE STRIKES AGAIN"**

She muttered under her breath. "They make him sound like some kind of criminal. He's saving people."

Flash leaned over. "Hey, at least he's doing something. That guy got guts. Unlike those mutants who only fight for themselves."

Peter froze, half-bitten sandwich hovering in midair.

Harry smirked. "What about you, Parker? You think he's a hero or a menace?"

Peter forced a smile. "I think… sometimes people just do what they can. Even if no one gets it."

MJ looked up, curious at his tone, but said nothing.

When the final bell rang, Peter and Gwen stayed behind in the lab. The late sunlight painted the beakers gold. Gwen tapped a pen against her notebook.

"You ever feel like people only see a fraction of who you are?" she asked suddenly.

Peter looked up from his microscope. "All the time."

She smiled faintly. "Then maybe that's a good thing. Keeps life interesting."

Peter smiled back, though behind it sat a thought he could never voice.

If only you knew.

Gwen asks, "So, when will you ask MJ out for your first Homecoming party".

Peter "I haven't thought about it yet."

Gwen "Oh come on, I know you like her, and what could possibly go wrong."

Peter "I am afraid I could jeopardize our friendship."

Harry from behind "And that's why you need to have some faith in yourself"

Peter surprised "Harry, what are you still doing here."

Harry "My dad is still busy, I thought of staying here and do my homework."

Gwen "You, doing homework, did the sun rised from east?"

Harry "Very funny"

Suddenly Peter's spider-sense tingles, he leaves immediately saying his friends.

Harry and Gwen are curious to know what is going on with him these days.

That night, the city called again - a police chase downtown, a mugging near the bridge, a child stuck in a fire escape.

By dawn, Spider-Man had saved three lives, stopped two robberies, and collected enough bruises to make an anatomy chart jealous.

And somewhere, under the early morning rain, a man named **Hammerhead** watched the news footage with cold amusement.

"So, the bug is still buzzing," he muttered. "Time to swat it for good."

He picked up his phone.

"Find me Aleksei Sytsevich. Tell him I've got an offer."

---

## Chapter 3: The City That Never Sleeps

Night had fallen over **Midtown**, but the city's pulse never slowed. Neon lights flickered against rain-slicked streets; car horns blared, and sirens threaded through the concrete canyons like anxious whispers. Somewhere in the shadows, a different kind of storm was brewing.

In a dimly lit warehouse near the docks, **Hammerhead** sat behind a scarred steel desk, a half-empty glass of bourbon in one hand. His eyes followed the grainy footage on a flickering monitor: Spider-Man swinging through Midtown, saving lives, stopping small-time criminals with ease.

"The kid's a problem," Hammerhead muttered, voice rough like gravel. He slammed the glass down, the amber liquid spilling onto the desk. "I've tried the usual muscle. He's smarter than anyone I've sent. Stronger. Faster. But everyone has a weakness."

From the shadows, a figure stepped forward - **Aleksei Sytsevich**, nervous but desperate. "Mr. Hammerhead… you said you had a way. A way to… fix this. To end it."

Hammerhead smiled, the faintest glint of steel in his eyes. "I've got something better. Power, Aleksei. Enough to crush him. Enough to make sure no one calls him hero again."

Aleksei's hands trembled. "What… what do I have to do?"

Hammerhead leaned forward, voice low and dangerous. "Take this." He placed a small vial on the desk, glowing faintly in the dim light. "From Oscorp. One shot. Inject it. I promise you'll have strength like you've never dreamed. And Spider-Man… will regret the day he stepped into this city."

Aleksei swallowed hard, staring at the liquid as if it burned. "And if it goes wrong?"

Hammerhead's smile widened. "It won't. Or… if it does, it'll make Spider-Man pay twice."

The words lingered in the stale air. Aleksei picked up the vial, the weight of choice pressing down on him like a hammer. He closed his eyes. He thought about the ridicule, the failures, the endless shadow of Spider-Man's victories. And then, with a shuddering hand, he injected the serum into his veins.

Pain flared instantly. Heat, strength, something monstrous swelling inside him. His bones shifted, muscles tore and rebuilt, sinew stretching. The mirror across the room reflected the **transformation**: human replaced by beast, Aleksei replaced by **the Rhino**.

He roared, a sound that split the concrete walls and rattled Hammerhead's whiskey glass. Fists clenched, the knuckles cracking like firecrackers. "I… I feel… unstoppable," he growled.

Hammerhead nodded, leaning back in his chair. Satisfaction etched in every line of his face. "Go. Show him what happens when you bite more than you can chew."

Meanwhile, next morning at Midtown High, Peter Parker sat hunched over a circuit board in the lab with Gwen. His hands were steady, precise, but his mind wandered the day ahead: school, homework, maybe a patrol if time allowed. Suddenly Rhino appears outside Midtown high and starts chaos.

Peter's chest tightened. He is looking outside through the window. "Not today…" he muttered.

The city groaned beneath the first blows of Rhino's rampage.

Outside Midtown High, some students were leaving early for the day, unaware that the halls they had walked safely were about to be swept into chaos. Teachers shouted, windows rattled, and screams echoed as Rhino smashed through the gates, swinging a massive steel pipe.

Before Gwen could react and look towards Peter, he already ran, taking his bag.

He is running through the hallway, taking his mask and web shooters from the bag, and removed his shirt revealing his suit beneath.

---

## Chapter 4: Chaos at Midtown

The bell hadn't rung yet, but the halls of **Midtown High** were already alive with the usual chatter. Students laughed, lockers clanged, sneakers squeaked across the linoleum. Then, a low rumble shook the building, rattling lockers and sending books tumbling.

"What the-?" MJ froze, looking out the window.

Outside, the streets were chaos. A massive figure - gray, horned, impossibly muscular - barreled down the avenue. **Rhino**. Cars skidded, pedestrians screamed, and a city bus screeched to a halt, its brakes screaming in protest.

Peter's chest tightened beneath his uniform. He wears the mask he was holding in his arms. Without thinking, he sprinted, leaving everything behind.

Through the classroom window, **Gwen, MJ, Harry, and Flash** watched the carnage unfold.

"Is that…?" Gwen whispered, squinting.

Spider-Man leapt into the fray, web-swinging between streetlamps and bouncing off walls with effortless precision. He landed in front of Rhino just as the villain swung a steel beam, sending a car spinning into the sidewalk.

Flash's face lit up with awe. "That's… that's Spider-Man!"

"Stay back!" MJ shouted instinctively, grabbing Flash by the arm. "Don't go near him!"

But the sight of Spider-Man in action was intoxicating. Flash let go of her hand and bolted toward the street. Harry and MJ exchanged panicked looks and followed, with Gwen trailing cautiously, her mind racing to anticipate the worst.

Spider-Man ducked, rolled, and kicked Rhino back toward a school bus. The vehicle teetered dangerously, and the students inside screamed. Spider-Man's reflexes were sharp, but Rhino was relentless.

Rhino's eyes caught movement - **Peter's friends** standing at the edge of the street. A cruel smile spread across the horned face. With a roar, he seized the bus and hurled it toward them.

"Spider-Man!" MJ screamed.

Spider-Man's muscles tensed. He launched a web, kicking the bus with enough force to nudge it forward and away from his friends. But Rhino saw the distraction as an opportunity.

Before Spider-Man could react, Rhino lunged, grabbing him with brute force. Spider-Man's body twisted, muscles straining against unnatural pressure. Bones cracked audibly, each one a dagger of pain. Spider-Man screamed, the sound cutting through the chaos.

MJ's hand trembled as she ran forward, but Gwen grabbed her shoulder. "Stop! Let him-"

Spider-Man's body went limp as Rhino released him and stomped away, leaving devastation in his wake. The city's chaos was mirrored in their hearts.

Before Rhino leaves, he stomps on Spider-Man, making him scream through pain and agony. Everyone is scared after seeing what they did to Spider-Man.

MJ felt something familiar hearing Spidey's scream, she goes near him reaching to the mask. Harry tries to stop her, but she still insisted to see the man behind the mask Slowly, deliberately, she removed it, revealing the **face she had known all her life**.

Her breath caught. Peter's eyes, bruised and teary, met hers. His lips trembled as he whispered, "MJ…"

Gwen, Harry, and Flash froze; the realization washing over them like a tidal wave. **Peter Parker. Spider-Man. All along.**

---

## Chapter 5: The Mask Revealed

Minutes later, before the authorities show up, MJ puts the mask back on and insists everyone to help him get him home. The friends agree, Flash lifted him; Harry takes his sports car parked outside and drove. Everyone gets inside the car and leaves the arena.

No one spoke much on the ride home. The silence was heavy with fear, confusion, and a dawning understanding: **Peter Parker had been living a double life; one none of them had fully grasped until now.**

**Peter's Home:**

MJ opens the door, Flash and Gwen go upstairs to take Peter to bedroom, while MJ and Harry try to gather all the supplies Gwen told them to bring.

Inside the bedroom, Flash helps to lie Peter on his bed, and Gwen begins assessing his injuries, her hands steady and precise. "We need to realign his bones and stabilize him. He's strong, but the trauma could be serious if we leave it. And we can't take him to the hospital; it will risk revealing his identity."

Flash, his jaw tight, volunteered. "I've helped with injuries before… let me."

MJ and Harry bring all the supplies; Gwen insists them to stay outside and bring some more supplies while she can do her procedure with Flash.

Gwen shuts the door. A few seconds later, they hear Peter screaming in pain as Flash tries to realign his bones. MJ couldn't handle it; Harry helps consoling her as she cries on his shoulder "I can't believe… I didn't even know…"

Hours passed, by night; Peter is resting, stabilized, and unconscious. He is sleeping in the position so his bones could rest, and Gwen made her own saline solution that is flowing through Peter's bloodstream.

The friends collapsed in chairs around him, exhausted but resolute. They had just crossed a threshold: the secret was out, the danger real, and their lives forever intertwined with Spider-Man's.

Flash admires Gwen's intellect and quick-thinking under pressure, and Gwen thanks Flash for helping her perform the procedures as she couldn't have done by herself.

May's keys jingled at the front door. The friends exchanged hurried glances. Harry and MJ rushed to intercept her, stalling, while Gwen stayed behind, keeping an eye on Peter.

May entered, cheerful at first, then froze as she saw the scene: bruised, bandaged, and exhausted; Peter lay on the bed. Her hand flew to her mouth. "Peter!"

Peter weakly tried to sit up, but Gwen steadied him. May's eyes filled with tears, scanning his face, lingering on the bruises. "Oh, my God… Peter…"

MJ, Harry, and Gwen tried to console her, explaining as best they could, while Peter remained silent, letting May take in the full scope of the truth.

Somewhere across the city inside a large mansion, a rugged hairy man watches a news where a kid talks about everything happened outside midtown high, he gently keeps his bottle of beer on the table.

---

## Chapter 6: The Standoff

A couple of days have passed since the incident. Peter is recovering faster than an average human. May hasn't gone to work since, and the kids haven't gone to school yet.

Harry tells May "I have known him as one of the smartest, sensible and mature guy, far more than anyone could be for his age, but never knew he has been carrying this responsibility for so long."

Everyone agrees with him.

Flash tells May "I am sorry Mrs. Parker, for so long I treated Peter so badly, he didn't deserve it."

May "Hey, you didn't need to apologize for anything."

Suddenly, the radio crackled into life. The familiar panicked voice of a reporter cut through static:

"- Rhino is back, terrorizing the streets outside Midtown High! Police are on site but unable to contain-"

Flash slammed his hands on the table. "Not again! I can't just sit here!"

Harry stepped forward, trying to calm him. "Flash, wait. We don't know what we're dealing with yet!"

MJ and Gwen exchanged worried looks, realizing Flash's temper would lead him straight into danger. "He's not thinking!" MJ muttered.

But Flash didn't care. He bolted the door. "I'm not letting him get away with this!"

Harry chased after him, trying to stop him. "You're going to get yourself killed!"

Flash spun around, jaw clenched. "Better me than letting him hurt anyone else!"

Gwen stepped between them, holding her arms wide. "Stop! You don't know what we're up against! But we need to do something… for Peter, as he did for all of use."

The streets outside the school were blocked. Rhino stomped, growling, "I want Spider-Man!" His massive form cast long shadows across the crumbling asphalt.

Police covered the parameters. Suddenly, a sleek sports car skidded to a halt in front of him. The back door opened, and Flash stepped out. "Hey Jackass! Didn't you had enough?"

Rhino "Give me Spider-Man, and I'll leave"

MJ, Harry, and Gwen followed, forming a loose line of defiance.

Flash "You want Spider-Man, you have to go through us"

Rhino laughed, a deep, grinding sound. "Fine by me." He charged.

The ground vibrated as Rhino approached. The kids are scared but still standing to their ground. As Rhino approaches, a low, menacing growl echoed from the shadows.

"Hey, bub. How about picking on someone your own size?"

Rhino stopped, turning. Standing in the alley, claws gleaming in the dim light, was Wolverine, in his leather jacket over tank top and jeans. His jaw was set, a grin tugging at the corner of his mouth as his claws extended with a metallic hiss.

Flash and the others' mouths dropped open. Relief washed over them - someone strong arrived to fight Rhino.

The fight erupted with bone-crunching ferocity. Rhino charged at Wolverine, as Wolverine moved with fluid precision, slashing and lunging with claws that could cut steel. Rhino roared in fury, swinging his massive fists, but Logan was faster, smarter, and brutal in his efficiency.

Peter's friends watched, eyes wide with awe, as Wolverine tore through the rampaging villain, each strike forcing Rhino back, weakening him inch by inch.

Finally, Wolverine pinned Rhino against a wall. Cutting his limbs and a horn. "Who sent you, punk? Tell me, or I'll make this worse."

With a defeated roar, Rhino muttered, "Hammerhead… he sent me… please, spare me!"

Logan grunted, stepping back, letting the now-defeated villain retreat. Turning to the kids, he sheathed his claws and crossed his arms.

"You kids are brave, don't worry, we will handle this from here" Wolverine said, his voice rough but approving. "And tell him… he's not alone in this fight. Not ever."

Relief and gratitude rippled through MJ, Gwen, Harry, and Flash. For the first time, they felt connected to the larger world - a world where Spider-Man wasn't the only hero.

---

## Chapter 7: A House of Secrets

Days later, **X-Men operatives** captured Hammerhead, unraveling his criminal network. News reports broadcast mutant intervention: Hammerhead imprisoned, stolen goods recovered, and Rhino incapacitated. Flash watched, shaking his head in awe.

"Maybe… maybe not all mutants are selfish," he said quietly.

MJ, Gwen, and Harry nodded. For Peter's friends, the world had suddenly grown wider, stranger, and yet… safer. And Spider-Man, their friend, was no longer facing it alone.

The apartment was quiet in the late afternoon, bathed in a soft golden glow from the sun filtering through the blinds. Peter sat at the edge of the dining table, leaning slightly, still fragile from the injuries he had sustained. Harry helped him settle into the chair, his hands steady, firm, and protective.

MJ, Gwen, May, and Flash lingered nearby, exchanging subtle glances, their curiosity and concern palpable. They had waited for this moment - for Peter to speak, to reveal everything.

Peter took a deep breath. "I… I need to tell you all something. About who I am… what happened to me… what I've been doing."

MJ leaned forward, eyes wide. "We're listening."

Peter's hands trembled slightly. He closed his eyes and began. "It started a year ago… with a spider bite. It… changed me. I don't just mean it gave me strength or agility. It gave me responsibility. I became… Spider-Man. I've been trying to live up to the lessons Uncle Ben taught me. I've been trying to do the right thing."

He paused, swallowing hard. "Ben… his death… it was my fault. I didn't stop the man who killed him. I… I thought if I could make it right somehow, I could prevent it from happening to anyone else. That's why I've been keeping this a secret. I didn't want May to overreact. I didn't want anyone to stop me. I thought I was protecting everyone."

Harry's expression shifted from disbelief to overwhelming admiration. "Peter, I thought we were best friends but know I feel like you didn't trust me enough to share this part of your life."

Gwen's voice trembled slightly, touched with a mix of awe and chagrin. "All this time, I thought you were discussing wild theories… and you were actually… doing this. You didn't have to hide it from us."

Flash crossed his arms, face conflicted, finally letting out the words he needed to say. "And all this time you pretended to be weak… so I could best you, tease you. I… I get it now."

MJ: "You know I always supported Spider-Man, supported you. We spent our entire childhood together; you could have told me."

Peter's eyes met theirs, exhausted but sincere. "I'm sorry. Truly. I thought I was doing the right thing. I was afraid… afraid I'd change everything between us. I didn't want anyone to worry."

May's eyes filled with tears; her voice shook, choked with relief and fear.

Peter reached out to her, voice soft. "I'm okay, Aunt May. I'm… still me."

May shook her head, tears streaking her face. "It's not about you being okay. It's about trust, Peter. You can't face this alone. You must let us in… we only have each other. Ben would be proud of you for the boy you turned into, and his death is not your fault, but that doesn't give you the right to hide all of this from me or the people who loves you."

Peter nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. "I understand… I am sorry."

Silence fell over the room for a heartbeat. Then Harry spoke, breaking it with warmth in his voice: "You won't be fighting alone. We've talked about it. We'll stand with you."

Flash nodded, a spark of newfound admiration in his eyes. "Yeah. Anything you need."

Gwen's gaze was steady and resolute. MJ's hand squeezed Peter's. "You need us, just as we need you. Even heroes need help."

Peter smiled faintly, a sense of weight being lifted from his shoulders.

Harry gets up, "Okay, we are going to celebrate this, our new team."

Everyone disagrees to him, Gwen talks about schoolwork, MJ talks about Peter getting rest, May talks about eating home cooked food, there is buzz all over the room.

Outside the window, Midtown continued its chaotic rhythm. But inside, in that apartment, a new era had begun. Spider-Man was no longer alone.

---

## Chapter 8: You're Not Alone

The morning sunlight spilled across Midtown, illuminating Peter's bedroom as the five friends gathered around the small table, strewn with notebooks, gadgets, and half-finished projects. Peter leaned against the desk, still tender from the fight, but the spark in his eyes was unmistakable.

"So, what's the plan?" Flash asked, his voice carrying a mix of excitement and newfound respect. "We can't just sit around and wait for the next Rhino."

MJ smiled, rolling up her sleeves. "We've been talking. If Peter's going to be out there, we need to make sure he's never alone. We can gather information, analyze threats, and help him with tech, media coverage, even research."

Gwen adjusted her glasses, scanning the blueprints Peter had sketched for his latest web-shooter upgrades. "I can help with the science side. Spider-Man tech is still primitive compared to what he could achieve with proper support. And I want to make sure we understand what we're dealing with before it hits the streets."

Harry leaned back, a grin breaking across his face. "I'll handle logistics. Cars, routes, equipment, keeping an eye on the city's underworld. If anyone's going to help Peter without blowing his cover, it's us."

Peter shook his head slightly, smiling. "I never thought I'd see the day where all of you would willingly get involved. It's… reassuring. More than I can say."

Flash nudged him playfully. "You better believe it, Parker. After what I saw, there's no way I'm standing on the sidelines. Not again."

MJ reached over, holding Peter's hand. "We've always believed in Spider-Man. And now we know why. But more than that… we believe in _you_, Peter."

The room was silent for a beat, each of them letting the weight of that moment sink in. Outside, the city continued its relentless rhythm, but here, in this small apartment, a team had formed - five friends bound together by trust, courage, and loyalty.

A few hours later, as the sun dipped below the skyline, Peter suited up. Swinging through Midtown, the city's lights reflecting off his suit, he felt a **renewed sense of purpose**. People cheered from the streets, kids pointed upward in admiration, and somewhere, a camera from the local news captured his figure as he soared above the chaos.

Returning home, Peter found his friends already huddled in his living room, sketching, planning, and preparing for what was next. MJ spread out the first mock-up of a communication network. Gwen had drawn diagrams of enhanced web-shooters and defensive gear. Harry had a map of Midtown, pinpointing potential crime hotspots. Flash leaned back in his chair, smirking, clearly enjoying his new role in the group.

Peter smiled, leaning against the doorframe. "Looks like I've got a whole network now. Not just me. Us."

MJ grinned, looping her arm through his. "Exactly. Heroes need help. And we've got your back."

Gwen looked at Flash and Harry. "Think of it as… Spider-Man support staff. Only cooler."

Harry laughed. "Spider-Team. Catchy, huh?"

Flash rolled his eyes but couldn't hide his smile. "As long as we keep Peter alive, I don't care what we call it."

They all laughed, the tension of the past week dissolving in camaraderie and shared purpose. Outside, the city thrummed with life, a world that would continue testing them, but inside that apartment, **friendship had become armor, trust had become a weapon, and loyalty had become the foundation of something far greater**.

Peter is attending school regularly, and to everyone's surprise, Flash was showing interest in studies, and the teacher was impressed. The school day ended, and the students left with copies of the **school newspaper**, front page emblazoned with:

**"Spider-Man and Wolverine Save Midtown High - Heroes Among Us!"**

Peter held the paper, smiling as his friends crowded around. Cheers, laughter, and playful teasing filled the air. Flash ruffled Peter's hair. Gwen and Harry exchanged quiet smiles. MJ looks at him, chuckling at his reaction.

### Homecoming Night

The gymnasium at Midtown High looked almost unrecognizable.

Soft lights hung from the ceiling, reflecting silver streamers and balloons swaying gently to the music. The chatter of students blended with laughter and the low hum of anticipation a rare night where homework, expectations, and secrets were momentarily forgotten.

Peter Parker stood awkwardly near the entrance, tugging at the collar of a borrowed suit jacket.

"I hate this already," he muttered.

Flash clapped a hand on his shoulder. "Relax Parker, you survived Rhino. You can survive a dance."

Harry adjusted his tie in the reflection of a trophy case, grinning. "Besides, you don't get out of this one. We _forced_ you to prepare for a reason."

Peter exhaled, scanning the room until he saw her.

Across the gym, Mary Jane Watson stood beside Gwen near the refreshment table. MJ wore a simple but elegant dress, confident without trying, her smile effortless. Gwen leaned in, whispering something that made MJ laugh softly - the kind of laugh Peter had known since childhood.

For a moment, the noise faded.

MJ looked up.

Their eyes met.

She excused herself from Gwen and walked toward Peter, every step deliberate, calm. Peter felt his heart hammer louder than any fight he'd ever been in.

"Hey," she said gently.

"Hey," he replied, suddenly forgetting every sentence he'd rehearsed in his head.

MJ tilted her head, studying him - the nerves, the posture, the boy she'd known forever trying not to look terrified. Her smile softened.

"I know," she said.

Peter blinked. "You… know-"

She nodded. "About your feelings? Yeah. It wasn't exactly a secret."

He swallowed. "MJ, I-"

She stepped closer, extending her hand. "You don't have to worry about it. Just… dance with me."

For a second, Peter hesitated; then he took her hand.

They stepped onto the dance floor together as the music swelled, slow and steady. The world narrowed to movement and rhythm. Peter wasn't Spider-Man here. He wasn't carrying guilt or responsibility or bruises under his skin.

He was just Peter Parker.

Flash leaned against the bleachers nearby, watching with a half-smile. Gwen joined him, arms crossed and amused.

"Didn't think I'd ever see him relax," Flash said.

Gwen smirked. "He needed this more than he'll ever admit."

Harry stood off to the side, drink in hand, eyes on Peter and MJ, smiling quietly, satisfied. Things were finally falling into place.

Then, a subtle vibration.

One by one, their watches lit up.

Red.

Peter felt it instantly. The shift. The call.

MJ noticed his expression change before he even spoke. She glanced down at his wrist, then back at him.

"Time?" she asked.

Peter nodded, apologetic. "I'm sorry…"

MJ squeezed his hand, smiling not sad, not afraid. Just understanding.

"Go get them, tiger."

Peter's breath caught. He smiled back, nodding at Flash, Gwen, and Harry. They moved instinctively, blocking sightlines, creating distractions, laughter rising as Flash deliberately knocked over a stack of chairs.

Peter slipped away.

By the time anyone noticed, Peter was already gone.

High above the city, Spider-Man swung from web to web, the wind in his face, the cheers below him, and the knowledge that **he was never truly alone**.

Somewhere in the distance, the city's lights glimmered like stars, hinting at the challenges to come, the threats yet unseen, and the friends who would stand beside him, ready for the next swing.
