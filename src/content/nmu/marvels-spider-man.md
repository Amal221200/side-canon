## Prelude

_"My name is Peter Parker. I'm just a regular high school kid from Queens… who also happens to be your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man._

_It's been a year since that bite, the one from a genetically enhanced spider that changed everything. It gave me the abilities of a spider:_ _wall-crawling, super strength, enhanced senses, agility, and, somehow, the responsibility that comes with them._

_At first, I didn't know what to do with any of it. I used to sneak into underground fights, testing how far my powers could go. One night, after a match, a thief ran past me. I could've stopped him, but I didn't. I thought it wasn't my problem._

_Later that night, my Uncle Ben was murdered by that same thief._

_That was the moment my life changed forever._

_Since then, I've tried to honor his words, "With great power comes great responsibility." I became Spider-Man, fighting for the people who can't fight for themselves, stopping crime, saving lives, and trying every day to live up to the man my uncle wanted me to be._

_In just one year, a lot has happened. I built my own web-shooters, designed a few prototype suits before perfecting one, and took down villains like Batroc, Trap-Master, and even Aleksei Sytsevich in his Rhino armor. But the real problem? The crime lords hiding behind it all, Hammerhead and Tombstone. They control everything from the shadows… and Spider-Man keeps getting in their way._

_I live with my Aunt May, the strongest woman I know. She works multiple jobs just to afford my education, never once complaining, never once giving up. And somehow, she still finds time to worry about me being late for dinner._

_My friends are my world:_

_Harry Osborn - the confident one who believes in me even when I don't._

_Mary Jane Watson - my childhood friend with dreams bigger than this city._

_Gwen Stacy - my lab partner, sharp as lightning and always two steps ahead._

_And Flash Thompson - the school quarterback who's made it his mission to remind me I'm not cool._

_So yeah… this is my story._

_A high school student, a part-time scientist, and a superhero._

_And this is the story of how I became the first real hero of the modern age -_

_the story of Spider-Man."_

## Chapter 1: A Year in Red and Blue

### **Weekend in the Webs**

Saturday afternoon in Queens had a different rhythm.

The sun hung high over brick rooftops and fire escapes, washing the city in heat and noise. Car horns, music spilling from open windows, kids shouting in the distance, all of it blurred together as a red-and-blue streak arced above the streets.

Spider-Man moved easily in daylight.

He timed his swings between buses and delivery trucks, adjusting web length on instinct, feet brushing walls as he redirected momentum. People pointed out. Some waved. Others pulled out their phones.

He didn't slow.

The police scanner crackled in his ear.

"-possible purse snatching, Queensboro Plaza-"

"Copy," Peter muttered, already banking left.

A quick stop. A webbed wrist. A purse returned to a shaken woman who barely had time to say thank you before Spider-Man was gone again.

He didn't wait for it.

By evening, the sun dipped low, and the city softened, long shadows stretching across rooftops as Peter perched atop a billboard, adjusting a web-shooter clogged with grit.

Saturday nights were louder. Messier.

A hit-and-run near the avenue.

A fight spilling out of a convenience store.

A fire escape bending under too much weight.

He worked fast, efficiently, saving strength where he could, listening, choosing which sirens to follow and which to leave to the police.

Between calls, he checked the time.

No homework due until Monday. No alarms are waiting in the morning.

Just one more swing.

Sunday morning came with sore muscles and a bruised rib that protested every deep breath.

Peter finished his breakfast quickly, forcing himself to eat more than he wanted to. Aunt May stood near the sink, already halfway through her morning routine.

"I'm heading out," Peter said, grabbing his bag. "Studying at Gwen's place. Might be a long one."

Aunt May glanced over her shoulder, smiling. "Don't stay out too late. And come home for dinner if you can."

"I will," Peter said easily. "Okay."

She nodded, satisfied, and Peter slipped out the door.

Peter moved slower now, perched on a church steeple as the city below woke up, bakery doors opening, joggers passing, church bells ringing.

He stretched carefully, testing what still hurt.

"Okay," he muttered. "We're not broken. That's a win."

The scanner chimed again.

A lost kid near the park.

A break-in gone wrong.

A dog trapped on a roof.

Not all heroics made headlines.

By afternoon, the sun was harsh again, sweat soaking into the suit beneath the mask. Peter stopped long enough to re-web a torn seam and drink water from a rooftop hose, head tilted back, breathing hard.

He thought about going home.

He didn't.

By Sunday night, the city finally slowed.

Neon lights flickered on. The river reflected the moon in broken lines. Peter landed on a rusted water tower overlooking the East River, chest heaving, hands braced on his knees.

Below, two figures smashed a jewelry store window and scrambled out, bags clinking.

Peter sighed.

"Guys," he said quietly, tightening his gloves, "you picked the worst possible night."

He leapt.

Web. Flip. Impact. Two quick strikes and a lamppost later, the thieves hung upside down, wrapped tight.

Sirens approached.

Peter was already swinging away.

Hours later, back in his small Queens bedroom, Peter peeled off the mask and let it drop onto his desk. He caught his reflection in the mirror, exhaustion etched into his face, bruises darkening, eyes heavy but alive.

Two days.

No breaks. No applause.

Just… work.

On his desk sat an old photograph, Uncle Ben, smiling wide, hand resting on Peter's shoulder.

Peter picked it up, thumb brushing the corner.

"Still trying," he whispered. "Every weekend."

Outside, a siren wailed once, then faded.

Peter lay back on his bed, muscles screaming, eyes closing.

Sunday night gave him that much.

Monday would ask for more.

## Chapter 2: The Web of Friends

Morning light spilled through the narrow windows of Midtown High, catching dust motes in soft, golden streaks. The bell rang. Lockers slammed. Sneakers squeaked across the linoleum.

It was chaos with a heartbeat, the kind Peter Parker had learned to love.

He moved through the crowded hallway clutching a half-eaten sandwich and a stack of homework. Beneath his shirt, a bruise near his collarbone pulsed faintly, a quiet reminder of last night's patrol.

"Morning, tiger."

Peter looked up and met Mary Jane Watson's grin, auburn hair tied back, camera slung over her shoulder, eyes bright with the same mischief she'd carried since they were kids climbing fences and chasing fireflies.

"You look like you lost a fight with gravity," she said.

Peter smiled. "More like chemistry homework. Gravity was kinder."

She laughed, nudging his arm. "One day you'll learn to sleep like a normal person, Parker."

"Sleep's overrated." Peter said in response, voice low.

"Tell that to your eye bags," a voice cut in.

They turned the corner to find Harry Osborn leaning against a locker, tie loosened, phone in hand, looking far too awake for the hour.

"There's my favorite nerd duo," Harry said, flashing Peter a grin. "MJ, you're looking suspiciously alive for first period."

"That's because I actually sleep," she shot back.

Harry clapped Peter on the shoulder. "Party at my place this weekend. You're coming. No excuses. No homework. No mysterious disappearances. I'm not taking no for an answer."

Peter hesitated. "I'll… try."

"Try means yes," Harry said. That effortless Osborn confidence is already sealing the deal.

A football thudded loudly against a locker behind them.

Flash Thompson strolled down the hall, quarterback confidence radiating from every step. He smirked when he saw Peter.

"Hey Parker. Forget your lunch money again, or are you saving it for a microscope fund?"

MJ rolled her eyes. "Grow up, Flash."

Flash shrugged. "Just saying hi to my favorite nerd."

Before Peter could respond, a calm voice cut through the tension.

"Ignore him."

Gwen Stacy stood by her locker, arms full of science journals. Her blonde hair was tied neatly back, her expression composed but alert.

Flash scoffed once, then moved on.

Gwen handed Peter a small vial wrapped carefully in tissue. "You left this in the lab last day. Your formula ratios are off, again."

Peter blinked. "Oh. Thanks, Gwen. I didn't mean to-"

"You never do," she said with a faint smile. "But you're welcome."

Harry watched the exchange, amused. "So this is the genius lab partner I keep hearing about."

Gwen tilted her head slightly. "And you must be the distraction."

MJ laughed. Peter rubbed the back of his neck, smiling despite himself.

For a moment, everything felt normal, a fragile balance of classes, friendships, crushes, and the thousand secrets Peter carried with him every day.

### **Cafeteria**

At lunch, the four of them gathered at their usual table near the window overlooking the football field.

MJ scribbled notes for the school paper. Gwen sketched a circuit diagram in the margins of her notebook. Harry scrolled through messages. Flash sat a few tables away, finishing a post-practice snack.

Peter was finishing his notes, until MJ stopped typing and turned on the news.

**DAILY BUGLE: "SPIDER-MENACE STRIKES AGAIN"**

She scoffed. "They make him sound like a criminal. He's saving people."

Flash leaned over from his table. "Hey, at least he's doing something. Guy has guts. Unlike those mutants who only fight for themselves."

Peter froze, sandwich halfway to his mouth.

Harry smirked. "What about you, Parker? You think he's a hero or a menace?"

Peter swallowed and forced a shrug. "I think… sometimes people just do what they can. Even if no one gets it."

MJ looked up at him, curious at the tone but said nothing.

### **Lab**

After the final bell, the lab was quiet, bathed in late-afternoon sunlight. Beakers glowed amber beneath the fading day.

Gwen tapped her pen against her notebook. "You ever feel like people only see a fraction of who you are?"

Peter glanced up from his microscope. "All the time."

She smiled faintly. "Then maybe that's a good thing. Keeps life interesting."

Peter smiled back, though the thought he didn't voice sat heavy behind it.

_If only you knew._

### **Outside Campus**

As they stepped out onto the ground, Gwen nudged him lightly.

"So," she said, "when are you asking MJ to Homecoming?"

Peter groaned. "I haven't thought about it."

"Oh, come on," Gwen said. "I know you like her. What could possibly go wrong?"

"I'm afraid I'd jeopardize our friendship."

"And that," Harry said from behind them, "is why you need to have some faith in yourself."

Peter jumped slightly. "Harry, what are you still doing here?"

"My dad's busy," Harry shrugged. "Figured I'd stay and do homework."

Gwen raised an eyebrow. "You? Homework? Did the sun rise in the west today?"

Harry smirked. "Very funny."

Suddenly, Peter's Spider-Sense flared.

He stiffened, then forced a smile. "Hey, I… I gotta go. See you guys."

Before they could respond, he was already moving away.

Harry and Gwen exchanged glances.

"What's going on with him lately?" Gwen murmured, watching Peter disappear down the path.

Harry shrugged, slipping his hands into his pockets. "Who knows. He doesn't really share much."

They walked in silence for a few steps before Gwen glanced at him again.

"How long have you two known each other?" She asked.

Harry smiled faintly. "Since middle school. First week actually."

Gwen raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"Yeah," Harry said. "I was stuck on an algebra problem, couldn't figure it out. Out of nowhere, he just… leaned over and fixed it. Didn't even say much. Just pointed, explained it once, and just disappeared."

Gwen smiled. "That sounds like him."

"A few days later," Harry continued, "it was pouring. Like heavy rain. I was heading home in my dad's car and saw him on the side of the road, fixing the chain on his bike. Completely soaked. Clothes, bag… I was pretty sure his notebooks were ruined."

He shook his head slightly in the memory.

"I made my dad stop. Peter tried to say no, of course he did. But we dragged him into the car anyway. Took him to our place. My dad liked him instantly. Said he was smart. That night we got him new notebooks, clothes… whatever he needed."

Gwen listened quietly.

"After that," Harry said, "we were inseparable. He introduced me to MJ too. It didn't take long to figure out he was already into her. He wasn't exactly subtle."

Gwen laughed softly. "Figures."

She hesitated. "Is he always like this? Running off at the last second? Disappearing?"

Harry shook his head. "Not really. It started happening more after his uncle died."

Gwen slowed. "Uncle?"

"Yeah," Harry said. "His parents left when he was young. Not sure why. He grew up with his aunt and uncle. They were basically his mom and dad."

He swallowed. "The night his uncle was murdered… I've never seen anyone that broken. MJ and I stayed with him the whole day after the funeral. He barely spoke."

Gwen nodded slowly. "I've heard about it. Benjamin Parker."

"Yeah," Harry said. "That's him."

They reached the edge of the campus.

"I can tell you one thing," Harry added quietly. "I'd give my life for him. And I know, without a doubt, he'd do the same for any of us."

Gwen smiled, wiping her eyes before the tears could fall.

"He's lucky," she said. "To have friends like you."

Harry smiled back. "Thanks."

They stood for a moment, the evening breeze moving through the trees lining the campus road.

Harry glanced at Gwen. "Hey… you want a lift?"

She blinked. "I thought your dad was picking you up."

Harry smirked. "I said he is busy. I never said anything about picking me up."

Before she could respond, he reached into his pocket and casually pressed a button on a sleek key fob.

A soft electronic chime echoed down the street.

From farther up the road, a low hum grew louder, smoother, controlled. A dark, polished car rolled into view; headlights flashed once as it slowed near the curb.

Gwen stopped walking.

"…Okay," she said, genuinely impressed. "You're full of surprises."

Harry shrugged, trying not to look too pleased. "Comes in handy sometimes."

She shook her head, smiling as they headed toward the car. "You really don't act like someone who owns _that_."

Harry glanced back at the school, then at the empty path Peter had taken earlier.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "Guess not."

The car door opened smoothly. Gwen slid in, still glancing around, curiosity flickering behind her calm expression.

Harry followed, the door closing behind them as the car pulled away from the curb.

The school disappeared in the rearview mirror.

That night, the city called again.

A police chase downtown, Spider-Man webbed the lead car's axle, sending it spinning harmlessly into a stack of trash bags as officers closed in.

A mugging near the bridge, two quick webs, a sharp kick, and the thief was left dangling beneath the streetlight, cursing as Spider-Man vanished into the dark.

A child trapped on a fire escape, smoke curling from the window, small hands shaking as Spider-Man lifted them into his arms and carried them to safety just as flames licked the railing.

By dawn, Spider-Man had saved three lives, stopped two robberies, and collected enough bruises to make an anatomy chart jealous.

He perched briefly on a water tower as the sun crept over the skyline, chest aching, mask torn at the seam, then pushed himself back into motion.

The city never really slept.

Neither did he.

Somewhere across the city, a man named Hammerhead watched the footage with cold amusement inside his base.

"So," he muttered, lifting his glass of bourbon, "the bug's still buzzing."

He picked up his phone.

"Find me Aleksei Sytsevich," he said. "Tell him I've got an offer."

## Chapter 3: The City That Never Sleeps

Night had fallen over **Midtown**, but the city's pulse never slowed. Neon lights flickered against rain-slicked streets; car horns blared, and sirens threaded through the concrete canyons like anxious whispers. Somewhere in the shadows, a different kind of storm was brewing.

In a dimly lit warehouse near the docks, **Hammerhead** sat behind a scarred steel desk, a half-empty glass of bourbon in one hand. His eyes followed the grainy footage on a flickering monitor: Spider-Man swinging through Midtown, saving lives, stopping small-time criminals with ease.

"The kid's a problem," Hammerhead muttered, voice rough like gravel. He slammed the glass down, the amber liquid spilling onto the desk. "I've tried the usual muscle. He's smarter than anyone I've sent. Stronger. Faster. But everyone has a weakness."

From the shadows, a figure stepped forward, **Aleksei Sytsevich**, nervous but desperate. "Mr. Hammerhead… you said you had a way. A way to… fix this. To end it."

Hammerhead smiled, the faintest glint of steel in his eyes. "I've got something better. Power, Aleksei. Enough to crush him. Enough to make sure no one calls him hero again."

Aleksei's hands trembled. "What… what do I have to do?"

Hammerhead leaned forward, voice low and dangerous. "Take this." He placed a small vial on the desk, glowing faintly in the dim light. "From Oscorp. One shot. Inject it. I promise you'll have strength like you've never dreamed. And Spider-Man… will regret the day he stepped into this city."

Aleksei swallowed hard, staring at the liquid as if it burned. "And if it goes wrong?"

Hammerhead's smile widened. "It won't. Or… if it does, it'll make Spider-Man pay twice."

The words lingered in the stale air. Aleksei picked up the vial, the weight of choice pressing down on him like a hammer. He closed his eyes. He thought about the ridicule, the failures, the endless shadow of Spider-Man's victories. And then, with a shuddering hand, he injected the serum into his veins.

Pain flared instantly. Heat, strength, something monstrous swelling inside him. His bones shifted, muscles tore and rebuilt, sinew stretching. The mirror across the room reflected the **transformation**: humans replaced by beast, Aleksei replaced by **the Rhino**.

He roared, a sound that split the concrete walls and rattled Hammerhead's whiskey glass. Fists clenched, the knuckles cracking like firecrackers. "I… I feel… unstoppable," he growled.

Hammerhead nodded, leaning back in his chair. Satisfaction etched in every line of his face. "Go. Show him what happens when you bite more than you can chew."

### Midtown High

Meanwhile, next morning at Midtown High, Peter Parker sat hunched over a circuit board in the lab with Gwen. His hands were steady, precise, but his mind wandered the day ahead: school, homework, maybe a patrol if time allowed.

Suddenly Rhino appears outside Midtown high and starts chaos.

Peter's chest tightened, Spider-Sense flaring. He looks outside through the window, at Rhino. "Not today…" he muttered.

The city groaned beneath the first blows of Rhino's rampage.

Outside Midtown High, some students were leaving early for the day, unaware that the halls they had walked safely were about to be swept into chaos. Teachers shouted, windows rattled, and screams echoed as Rhino smashed through the gates, swinging a massive steel pipe.

Before Gwen could react and look towards Peter, he already ran, taking his bag.

He is running through the hallway, taking his mask and web shooters from the bag, and removed his T-shirt revealing his suit beneath.

---

## Chapter 4: Chaos at Midtown High

The bell hadn't rung yet, but the halls of Midtown High were already alive, lockers slamming, laughter echoing, sneakers squeaking across polished linoleum. It was the familiar chaos of another school morning.

Then the building _shuddered_.

Lockers rattled violently. Books slid off desks. A deep, distant rumble rolled through the floor, growing louder by the second.

"What the-?" MJ froze mid-sentence, turning toward the window.

Outside, the street was unraveling.

Cars skidded sideways, horns blaring in panic. Pedestrians scattered as a massive figure charged down the avenue, gray-skinned, horned, impossibly muscular.

Rhino.

A city bus screeched to a halt, its brakes screaming as it swerved to avoid him.

Peter's chest tightened beneath his T-shirt.

Not today.

His fingers closed around the mask he'd been holding. There was no plan, no hesitation, just instinct. He pulled it on as he moved, already sprinting for the door.

By the time Gwen turned back toward him, Peter was gone.

From the classroom window, Gwen, MJ, Harry, and Flash watched the street erupt into chaos.

"Is that…?" Gwen whispered, squinting, her mind racing.

A red-and-blue blur dropped into the street.

Spider-Man.

He swung low between streetlamps, flipped off a mailbox, and landed hard in front of Rhino just as the villain ripped a steel beam from a construction barrier and hurled it. Spider-Man twisted midair, webbing the beam and redirecting it just enough to send a parked car spinning harmlessly into the sidewalk instead.

Flash's face lit up with awe.

"That's… that's Spider-Man!"

"Flash, no!" MJ shouted, grabbing his arm. "Stay back!"

But it was already too late.

The sight was intoxicating, the power, the speed, the defiance. Flash yanked free and bolted toward the street.

"Flash!" Harry cursed, running after him.

MJ followed without thinking. Gwen hesitated only a moment before trailing behind, her eyes never leaving the fight.

Spider-Man moved fast, ducking, rolling, striking. He slammed both feet into Rhino's chest, knocking the giant backward toward the bus.

The bus teetered dangerously.

Students inside screamed.

Spider-Man fired a web, anchoring the bus to a streetlight just as it began to tip. His timing was perfect, but Rhino didn't care.

Rhino's gaze shifted.

He saw them.

Four kids at the edge of the street.

A slow, cruel smile spread across his face.

With a roar, Rhino picked up a car and threw at them.

"Spider-Man!" MJ screamed.

Spider-Man reacted instantly, webbing the car, twisting his body midair and pulling the car away from them and crashing sideways.

But that second was all Rhino needed.

As Spider-Man landed, Rhino slammed into him without giving him a window to react.

Rhino grabbed Spider-Man's body, twisted violently in his grip. The sound was unmistakable.

Crack_._

Spider-Man screamed.

The sound cuts through everything, louder than sirens, louder than metal tearing. Bones fractured under impossible pressure; each snaps a blade of pain.

"No-!" MJ started forward.

"Stop!" Gwen grabbed her shoulder, eyes wide with horror. "You can't-!"

Rhino hurled Spider-Man to the ground like discarded scrap. Spider-Man hit the pavement hard, rolling once before going still.

Rhino turned away, satisfied.

Then he stopped.

With deliberate cruelty, he turned back and stomped.

Spider-Man screamed again, the sound raw and broken.

The street went silent.

Even Rhino seemed to be done.

He turned and walked away, leaving destruction behind him.

MJ didn't hear Gwen calling her name.

She was already running.

Her knees hit the pavement beside Spider-Man as she reached for him, hands shaking. Something in that scream, something familiar_,_ had torn straight through her.

"MJ- wait," Harry said, grabbing her arm. "Don't-"

She pulled free.

Slowly. Carefully.

She reached for the mask.

Harry's hand hovered, torn between stopping her and knowing it was already too late.

MJ peeled the mask back.

Time has stopped.

Peter's face stared up at her, bruised, bloodied, eyes glassy with pain.

Her breath caught.

Peter's eyes fluttered open, unfocused but aware. He swallowed, lips trembling.

"M… MJ…"

Behind her, Gwen, Harry, and Flash froze.

The truth crashed into them all at once.

Peter Parker.

Spider-Man.

All along.

And nothing would ever be the same again.

---

## Chapter 5: The Mask Revealed

Minutes passed, no sirens yet, no authorities in sight.

MJ knelt beside Peter, her hands trembling only slightly as she lifted the mask and carefully pulled it back over his face. For a moment, she just stared at him, as if she needed the barrier again to keep herself steady.

"We can't stay," she said, her voice firm despite the fear behind it. "If the police get here… if anyone sees him like this-"

She didn't finish the sentence.

Flash nodded immediately. "We get him home. Now."

Harry was already moving, keys in hand. "My car's right outside."

Flash slid one arm under Peter's shoulders, careful despite the urgency. Peter groaned softly, pain cutting through the fog as Flash lifted him.

"Easy, Parker," Flash muttered. "I've got you."

They moved quickly, quietly, piling into Harry's car as Flash settled Peter across the back seat, Gwen supporting his legs, MJ holding his head steady.

The car pulled away just as distant sirens began to rise.

No one spoke on the drive.

The city lights passed in streaks across the windows, but inside the car there was only the weight of what they had seen, what they now knew.

Peter Parker had been living a double life.

And none of them had truly understood how heavy it was.

### **Peter's Home**

MJ unlocked the door with shaking hands.

Inside, everything felt painfully normal - the quiet hum of the apartment, the familiar smell of detergent and old books. It made what they were about to do feel unreal.

"Upstairs," Gwen said softly. "Careful."

Flash and Gwen carried Peter to his bedroom, easing him onto the bed. His breathing was shallow but steady, his body tense even in unconsciousness.

Gwen didn't waste time. She rolled up her sleeves and began assessing him - ribs, arms, spine - her movements precise, controlled.

"This is bad," she said quietly. "He heals faster than a normal person, but trauma like this… if it sets wrong, it could do permanent damage."

MJ swallowed. "The hospital-?"

"We can't," Gwen said immediately. "Too many questions. Too much risk."

Flash clenched his jaw. "Then tell me what you need."

Gwen glanced around the room - the sparse shelves, the small bathroom cabinet - and shook her head.

"There won't be enough here," she said. "Basic first aid won't cut it."

She turned to MJ and Harry. "I need you to get supplies."

"What kind?" Harry asked.

"Bandages. Sterile wraps. Saline. Painkillers. Whatever you can find," Gwen said. "A pharmacy, a medical supply store - anywhere. Move."

MJ hesitated. "Gwen-"

"Please," Gwen said, softer now. "Trust me."

MJ nodded, wiping her face, and followed Harry out the door.

Gwen turned back to Flash. "I'll guide you. I can't do this alone."

Flash nodded once. "Just tell me what to do."

Gwen closed the bedroom door.

MJ and Harry were halfway back up the stairs when the scream tore through the apartment.

Peter's voice - raw, broken, full of agony.

MJ froze.

The sound ripped straight through her, stealing the air from her lungs. Her knees buckled, and she slid down the wall, hands flying to her mouth.

"I didn't know," she sobbed. "I swear… I didn't know."

Harry dropped beside her, arms wrapping around her shoulders as she shook.

"He didn't let anyone know," he said quietly, holding her tighter. "Not a single one of us."

The scream faded - replaced by strained breathing, muffled instructions from behind the door.

MJ pressed her forehead to Harry's shoulder, tears soaking into his jacket.

Inside the room, Flash followed Gwen's steady voice.

Harry, "Come on MJ, let's move. They need our help."

MJ nods, still sobbing, stand up and leave the house with Harry.

Time stretched.

Minutes bled into hours.

By the time the door finally opened, night had settled outside the windows.

Peter lay unconscious but stable; his body positioned carefully to allow his bones to heal. A saline IV dripped slowly beside him.

**The apartment was quieter now - the kind of quiet that came after the medical team sent by Norman, who knew exactly what they were doing had finished their work and slipped away without questions.**

Flash sank into a chair, exhausted, staring at his hands.

Gwen exhaled slowly, wiping sweat from her brow. "He'll heal. It'll take time… but he will."

Flash looked at her, awe and respect clear in his eyes.

"I couldn't have done that without you."

Gwen shook her head. "Neither could I."

They stayed there, all of them, sitting around Peter's bed, drained, shaken, but unwilling to leave.

They had crossed a line.

The secret was out.

The danger was real.

And their lives were now permanently tied to Spider-Man's.

The sound of keys jingling broke the silence.

Everyone froze.

"Aunt May," MJ whispered.

They are completely out of the idea of how to handle this.

She opened the room door, smiling at first, hoping he had invited friends.

Then she saw the bandages. The bruises. The stillness.

"Peter?" Her voice broke as she rushed forward. "Peter!"

Peter stirred weakly, trying to lift his head. Gwen tried to make Peter avoid any moments, letting the others handle May.

May's hands trembled as she took in his injuries, tears filling her eyes.

"Oh my God… Peter…"

MJ and Harry spoke softly, carefully, trying to explain, trying not to overwhelm her. Peter stayed silent, letting her see the truth for herself.

Fear. Shock. Understanding.

And love.

Somewhere across the city, in a sprawling mansion bathed in dim light, a rugged, bearded man watched the news in silence.

A shaky video replayed on the screen, students shouting, sirens wailing, chaos outside Midtown High.

The man slowly set his bottle of beer down on the table.

His eyes narrowed.

---

## Chapter 6: The Standoff

A couple of days have passed since the incident. Peter is recovering faster than an average human. May hasn't gone to work since, and the kids haven't gone to school yet.

Harry tells May, "I have known him as one of the smartest, sensible and mature guy, far more than anyone could be for his age, but never knew he has been carrying this responsibility for so long."

Everyone agrees with him.

Flash tells May, "I am sorry Mrs. Parker, for so long I treated Peter so badly, he didn't deserve it."

May "Hey, you didn't need to apologize for anything."

Suddenly, the radio crackled into life. The familiar panicked voice of a reporter cut through static:

"- Rhino is back, terrorizing the streets outside Midtown High! Police are on site but unable to contain-"

Flash slammed his hands against the wall.

"Not again! I can't just sit here!"

He stormed out of the room.

Harry followed immediately. Gwen and MJ exchanged worried looks before hurrying after them.

Flash reached the hallway door.

Harry caught up to him, grabbing his shoulder.

"What do you think you're doing?" Harry said. "You walk out that door like this… you don't come back."

Flash laughed bitterly.

"You think I don't know that?"

Harry's voice cracked, just slightly.

"You're going to get yourself killed!"

Flash's hand stayed on the doorknob.

"Better me than letting him hurt anyone else," Flash said.

Gwen stepped between them.

"Stop," she said. "Both of you. You don't know what we're up against. But we need to do something… for Peter, as he did for all of us."

### Street, Outside Midtown High

The streets outside the school were blocked. Rhino stomped, growling, "I want Spider-Man!" His massive form cast long shadows across the crumbling asphalt.

Police covered the parameters. Suddenly, a sleek sports car skidded to a halt in front of him. The back door opened, and Flash stepped out. "Hey Jackass! Didn't you had enough?"

Rhino "Give me Spider-Man, and I'll leave"

MJ, Harry, and Gwen followed, forming a loose line of defiance.

Flash "You want Spider-Man, you have to go through us"

Rhino laughed, a deep, grinding sound. "Fine by me." He walked.

Rhino laughed, a deep, grinding sound. "Fine by me." He walked towards them.

The ground vibrated as Rhino approached, the police barricades rattling as if they were about to snap loose. Sirens wailed somewhere behind the perimeter, their lights washing the street in red and blue.

The kids stood frozen.

MJ's fingers clenched into Harry's sleeve.

Gwen's breath came shallow, measured.

Flash didn't move, even as instinct screamed at him to run.

Then the sound came.

Low. Rough. Close.

A growl that cut through the chaos.

"Hey, bub," a voice said from the shadows near the school gates.

"How about picking on someone your own size?"

Rhino stopped, boots grinding across broken pavement. He turned.

A man stepped forward from beside a dented police cruiser, leather jacket, tank top, jeans worn thin at the knees. Short, broad, solid. He looked at Rhino like he was measuring a broken machine.

Snikt.

Metal claws slid free with a sharp, unmistakable hiss.

Flash's mouth fell open.

"Oh my-"

Rhino snorted. "You?" He laughed, rolling his shoulders. "I eat guys like you for breakfast."

Wolverine cracked his neck once.

"Then choke on this."

Rhino roared and charged.

Not reckless, direct. A battering ram aimed straight at Wolverine.

Wolverine sprinted forward too.

At the last second, he dove sideways. Rhino thundered past, his horn smashing into a police van. The vehicle lifted off the ground and slammed back down, tires bursting.

Before Rhino could turn, Wolverine was already on him, leaping, claws driving into the thick muscle of Rhino's shoulder.

Rhino howled and swatted him out of the air.

Wolverine hit the pavement hard, skidding across the road until he slammed into the metal school gate. The impact rang like a bell.

MJ gasped.

"He- he hit him like-"

Wolverine pushed himself up slowly, blood trickling from his brow, already sealing.

"Yeah," he muttered. "That tracks."

Rhino charged again, swinging wide. Wolverine ducked under the punch as it obliterated a streetlight, sparks showering the road. Wolverine slashed across Rhino's thigh, shallow, and precise.

Rhino staggered, snarling.

"You're fast!" Rhino bellowed. "But you're not strong enough!"

He grabbed Wolverine mid-motion and slammed him into the hood of a squad car. The engine block crumpled. Wolverine rolled off just as Rhino brought both fists down, smashing the car flat.

The kids flinched.

Wolverine came up behind Rhino and climbed him, claws biting into armor seams, joints, anywhere he could slow him down. Rhino staggered toward a stopped school bus, slamming his back against it.

The bus rocked violently.

Police lights flashed across his armor. The school loomed behind Wolverine, concrete steps, glass doors, silhouettes of students and teachers frozen in terror.

Rhino's eyes flicked past Wolverine.

He smiled.

"Still got leverage," he growled.

Before anyone could react, Rhino lunged sideways, wrapping both arms around a stopped school bus near the barricade. Metal screamed as he lifted it off the ground, wheels spinning, glass shattering.

Flash screamed.

"WOLVERINE!"

Rhino roared, muscles bulging as he turned toward the school.

"LET'S SEE YOU STOP THIS!"

The bus tilted, aimed straight at the front steps.

Something in Wolverine snapped.

He didn't shout.

He didn't warn.

He charged.

Wolverine dropped low, sprinting straight at Rhino as the bus began to rise higher. His posture changed, no tactics, no patience. Just instinct.

Feral.

Rhino barely had time to turn.

Wolverine slid beneath the bus as Rhino shifted his grip-

Snikt.

Wolverine's claws flashed upward.

The first strike carved deep into Rhino's left knee.

Bone cracked.

Rhino howled, his leg collapsing as the bus lurched violently. Wolverine didn't stop, he rolled, came up behind him, and slashed again.

The right leg went next.

Rhino screamed and fell forward, the bus crashing sideways into the pavement instead of the school, skidding to a halt in a shower of sparks.

The ground shook.

Before Rhino could even process the pain, Wolverine was on him.

He leapt onto Rhino's back, driving his claws down into both shoulders, severing muscle and locking the arms uselessly at Rhino's sides.

Rhino roared, trying to swing, nothing responded.

Wolverine yanked himself forward and slashed.

Both forearms.

Metal armor split. Flesh gave way.

Rhino collapsed fully now, face-first against the asphalt, bellowing in agony.

Wolverine landed in front of him.

Rhino tried to lift his head.

Bad idea.

Wolverine grabbed the horn with one hand.

Snikt.

One clean, brutal slice.

The horn hit the ground with a hollow clang.

Silence followed, broken only by Rhino's ragged breathing and distant sirens.

Wolverine stood over him, chest heaving, eyes wild. For a moment, it looked like he might keep going.

Then he stopped.

He crouched, pressing one claw tip into the pavement inches from Rhino's face.

Low. Controlled. Deadly calm.

Rhino tried to speak.

Wolverine raised a hand.

"Don't," he said.

He crouched beside Rhino, voice low, not angry, not curious. Certain.

"I know who sent you."

Rhino's breath hitched.

"You were never the plan," Wolverine continued. "You were noise. A distraction."

Rhino whimpered, fear finally overtaking the rage.

Wolverine stood, looking down at him.

"You don't come after kids," he said flatly.

"You don't bring this kind of fight to a school."

He turned away, already losing interest.

"Someone will be here for you," he added over his shoulder. "They won't be as patient."

Moments later, the sound of distant engines cut through the air.

He stood and stepped back, scanning the school, the kids, the damage, making sure the threat was truly over.

He turned to the kids who stood against Rhino. He sheathed his claws and crossed his arms.

"You kids are brave, don't worry, we will handle this from here" Wolverine said, his voice rough but approving. "And tell him… he's not alone in this fight. Not ever."

Relief and gratitude rippled through MJ, Gwen, Harry, and Flash. For the first time, they felt connected to the larger world, a world where Spider-Man wasn't the only hero.

## Chapter 7: A House of Secrets

Days later, **X-Men operatives** captured Hammerhead, unraveling his criminal network. News reports broadcast mutant intervention: Hammerhead imprisoned, stolen goods recovered, and Rhino incapacitated.

Flash watched, shaking his head in awe.

"Maybe… maybe not all mutants are selfish," he said quietly.

MJ, Gwen, and Harry nodded. For Peter's friends, the world had suddenly grown wider, stranger, and yet… safer. And Spider-Man, their friend, was no longer facing it alone.

The apartment was quiet in the late afternoon, bathed in a soft golden glow from the sun filtering through the blinds. Peter sat at the edge of the dining table, leaning slightly, still fragile from the injuries he had sustained. Harry helped him settle into the chair, his hands steady, firm, and protective.

MJ, Gwen, May, and Flash lingered nearby, exchanging subtle glances, their curiosity and concern palpable. They had waited for this moment for Peter, to speak, to reveal everything.

Peter took a deep breath. "I… I need to tell you all something. About who I am… what happened to me… what I've been doing."

MJ leaned forward, eyes wide. "We're listening."

Peter's hands trembled slightly. He closed his eyes and began. "It started a year ago… with a spider bite. It… changed me. I don't just mean it gave me strength or agility. It gave me responsibility. I became… Spider-Man. I've been trying to live up to the lessons Uncle Ben taught me. I've been trying to do the right thing."

He paused, swallowing hard. "Ben… his death… it was my fault. I didn't stop the man who killed him. I… I thought if I could make it right somehow, I could prevent it from happening to anyone else. That's why I've been keeping this a secret. I didn't want May to overreact. I didn't want anyone to stop me. I thought I was protecting everyone."

Harry's expression shifted from disbelief to overwhelming admiration. "Peter, I thought we were best friends but know I feel like you didn't trust me enough to share this part of your life."

Gwen's voice trembled slightly, touched with a mix of awe and chagrin. "All this time, I thought you were discussing wild theories… and you were actually… doing this. You didn't have to hide it from us."

Flash crossed his arms, face conflicted, finally letting out the words he needed to say. "And all this time you pretended to be weak… so I could best you, tease you. I… I get it now."

MJ: "You know I always supported Spider-Man, supported you. We spent our entire childhood together; you could have told me."

Peter's eyes met theirs, exhausted but sincere. "I'm sorry. Truly. I thought I was doing the right thing. I was afraid… afraid I'd change everything between us. I didn't want anyone to worry."

May's eyes filled with tears; her voice shook, choked with relief and fear.

Peter reached out to her, voice soft. "I'm okay, Aunt May. I'm… still me."

May shook her head, tears streaking her face. "It's not about you being okay. It's about trust, Peter. You can't face this alone. You must let us in… we only have each other. Ben would be proud of you for the boy you turned into, and his death is not your fault, but that doesn't give you the right to hide all of this from me or the people who loves you."

Peter nodded, swallowing the lump in his throat. "I understand… I am sorry."

Silence fell over the room for a heartbeat. Then Harry spoke, breaking it with warmth in his voice: "You won't be fighting alone. We've talked about it. We'll stand with you."

Flash nodded, a spark of newfound admiration in his eyes. "Yeah. Anything you need."

Gwen's gaze was steady and resolute.

Peter at first in disbelief, "Guys, you don't have to do this."

MJ's hand squeezed Peter's. "You need us, just as we need you. Even heroes need help."

Peter smiled faintly, a sense of weight being lifted from his shoulders.

Harry gets up, "Okay, we are going to celebrate this, our new team."

Everyone disagrees with him, Gwen talks about schoolwork, MJ talks about Peter getting rest, May talks about eating home cooked food, there is buzz all over the room.

Outside the window, Midtown continued its chaotic rhythm. But inside, in that apartment, a new era had begun. Spider-Man was no longer alone.

## Chapter 8: You're Not Alone

The morning sunlight spilled across Midtown, illuminating Peter's bedroom as the five friends gathered around the small table, strewn with notebooks, gadgets, and half-finished projects. Peter leaned against the desk, still tender from the fight, but the spark in his eyes was unmistakable.

"So, what's the plan?" Flash asked, his voice carrying a mix of excitement and newfound respect. "We can't just sit around and wait for the next Rhino."

MJ smiled, rolling up her sleeves. "We've been talking. If Peter's going to be out there, we need to make sure he's never alone. We can gather information, analyze threats, and help him with tech, media coverage, even research."

Gwen adjusted her glasses, scanning the blueprints Peter had sketched for his latest web-shooter upgrades. "I can help with the science side. Spider-Man tech is still primitive compared to what he could achieve with proper support. And I want to make sure we understand what we're dealing with before it hits the streets."

Harry leaned back, a grin breaking across his face. "I'll handle logistics. Cars, routes, equipment, keeping an eye on the city's underworld. If anyone's going to help Peter without blowing his cover, it's us."

Peter shook his head slightly, smiling. "I never thought I'd see the day where all of you would willingly get involved. It's… reassuring. More than I can say."

Flash nudged him playfully. "You better believe it, Parker. After what I saw, there's no way I'm standing on the sidelines. Not again."

MJ reached over. "We've always believed in Spider-Man. And now we know why. But more than that… we believe in _you_, Peter."

The room was silent for a beat, each of them letting the weight of that moment sink in. Outside, the city continued its relentless rhythm, but here, in this small apartment, a team had formed, five friends bound together by trust, courage, and loyalty.

A few hours later, as the sun dipped below the skyline, Peter suited up. Swinging through Midtown, the city's lights reflecting off his suit, he felt a **renewed sense of purpose**. People cheered from the streets, kids pointed upward in admiration, and somewhere, a camera from the local news captured his figure as he soared above the chaos.

Returning home, Peter found his friends already huddled in his living room, sketching, planning, and preparing for what was next. MJ spread out the first mock-up of a communication network. Gwen had drawn diagrams of enhanced web-shooters and defensive gear. Harry had a map of Midtown, pinpointing potential crime hotspots. Flash leaned back in his chair, smirking, clearly enjoying his new role in the group.

Peter smiled, leaning against the doorframe. "Looks like I've got a whole network now. Not just me. Us."

MJ grinned, looping her arm through his. "Exactly. Heroes need help. And we've got your back."

Gwen looked at Flash and Harry. "Think of it as… Spider-Man support staff. Only cooler."

Harry laughed. "Team Spider. Catchy, huh?"

Flash rolled his eyes but couldn't hide his smile. "As long as we keep Peter alive, I don't care what we call it."

They all laughed, the tension of the past week dissolving in camaraderie and shared purpose. Outside, the city thrummed with life, a world that would continue testing them, but inside that apartment, **friendship had become armor, trust had become a weapon, and loyalty had become the foundation of something far greater**.

Peter is attending school regularly, and to everyone's surprise, Flash was showing interest in studies, and the teacher was impressed. The school day ended, and the students left with copies of the **school newspaper**, front page emblazoned with:

**"Spider-Man and Wolverine Save Midtown High - Heroes Among Us!"**

Peter held the paper, smiling as his friends crowded around. Cheers, laughter, and playful teasing filled the air. Flash ruffled Peter's hair. Gwen and Harry exchanged quiet smiles. MJ looks at him, chuckling at his reaction.

### Homecoming Night

The gymnasium at Midtown High looked almost unrecognizable.

Soft lights hung from the ceiling, reflecting silver streamers and balloons swaying gently to the music. The chatter of students blended with laughter and the low hum of anticipation a rare night where homework, expectations, and secrets were momentarily forgotten.

Peter Parker stood awkwardly near the entrance, tugging at the collar of a borrowed suit jacket.

"I hate this already," he muttered.

Flash clapped a hand on his shoulder. "Relax Parker, you survived Rhino. You can survive a dance."

Harry adjusted his tie in the reflection of a trophy case, grinning. "Besides, you don't get out of this one. We _forced_ you to prepare for a reason."

Peter exhaled, scanning the room until he saw her.

Across the gym, Mary Jane Watson stood beside Gwen near the refreshment table. MJ wore a simple but elegant dress, confident without trying, her smile effortless. Gwen leaned in, whispering something that made MJ laugh softly, the kind of laugh Peter had known since childhood.

For a moment, the noise faded.

MJ looked up.

Their eyes met.

She excused herself from Gwen and walked toward Peter, every step deliberate, calm. Peter felt his heart hammer louder than any fight he'd ever been in.

"Hey," she said gently.

"Hey," he replied, suddenly forgetting every sentence he'd rehearsed in his head.

MJ tilted her head, studying him, the nerves, the posture, the boy she'd known forever trying not to look terrified. Her smile softened.

"I know," she said.

Peter blinked. "You… know-"

She nodded. "About your feelings? Yeah. It wasn't exactly a secret."

He swallowed. "MJ, I-"

She stepped closer, extending her hand. "You don't have to worry about it. Just… dance with me."

For a second, Peter hesitated; then he took her hand.

They stepped onto the dance floor together as the music swelled, slow and steady. The world narrowed to movement and rhythm. Peter wasn't Spider-Man here. He wasn't carrying guilt or responsibility or bruises under his skin.

He was just Peter Parker.

Flash leaned against the bleachers nearby, arms folded, watching the dance floor with a half-smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

Gwen stepped up beside him, mirroring his stance. "You look… thoughtful. That's new."

Flash scoffed softly. "Don't spread it around. I've got a reputation."

She glanced at him. "You ever feel like people already decided who you are before you even open your mouth?"

Flash tilted his head, surprised. "Yeah."

A beat. "More than they should."

Gwen studied him for a moment. "You're not who you pretend to be."

He let out a short laugh. "Funny. I was about to say the same about you."

They watched Peter and MJ on the dance floor, laughing awkwardly, completely unaware of anything beyond each other.

"My dad's a cop," Gwen said casually, like it wasn't a big thing. "Teaches you to notice patterns. People, I mean."

Flash shifted his weight. "Yeah. I get that."

She glanced at him. "You don't talk about your family much."

He hesitated, just long enough to be noticeable, then shrugged. "Some things aren't great party conversation."

Gwen nodded. No pressure. No follow-up.

Instead, she smiled. "Well… for what it's worth, you're doing okay tonight."

Flash smirked. "High praise."

They stood there a moment longer, the music drifting over them, the night warm and forgiving.

"Hey," Flash said finally, pushing off the bleachers. "Wanna grab something to drink? Before someone starts a slow song and makes it weird."

Gwen smiled. "Lead the way."

They walked off together, not a couple, not yet, just two people choosing not to be alone for the moment.

Harry stood off to the side, drink in hand, eyes on Peter and MJ, smiling quietly, satisfied. Things were finally falling into place.

Then, a subtle vibration.

One by one, their watches lit up.

Red.

Peter felt it instantly. The shift. The call.

MJ noticed his expression change before he even spoke. She glanced down at his wrist, then back at him.

"Time?" she asked.

Peter nodded, apologetic. "I'm sorry…"

MJ squeezed his hand, smiling not sad, not afraid. Just understanding.

"Go get them, tiger."

Peter's breath caught. He smiled back, nodding at Flash, Gwen, and Harry. They moved instinctively, blocking sightlines, creating distractions, laughter rising as Flash deliberately knocked over a stack of chairs.

Peter slipped away.

By the time anyone noticed, Peter was already gone.

High above the city, Spider-Man swung from web to web, the wind in his face, the cheers below him, and the knowledge that **he was never truly alone**.

Somewhere in the distance, the city's lights glimmered like stars, hinting at the challenges to come, the threats yet unseen, and the friends who would stand beside him, ready for the next swing.
