## Chapter 1: Falling Light (1990)

The sky over Alaska was clear enough to lie.

Stars cut through the darkness like pinholes in black steel, steady and harmless, as if nothing beyond them was watching. Major Christopher Summers trusted skies like this. He always had. Thirty years in the cockpit taught him how to read clouds, turbulence, engine whine; but not omens.

The aircraft was old. Not obsolete; _classic_. A refurbished vintage transport he'd rebuilt with his own hands; metal and memory stitched together. Katherine had teased him for it.

"You love this plane more than the Air Force ever did," she said, smiling as she buckled Alex in.

Scott, sitting by the window, didn't hear the joke. He was watching the stars.

He was ten. Old enough to notice patterns. Young enough to believe they meant something.

The vibration came first.

Not turbulence; Christopher knew that instantly. This was sharper. Intentional. The instruments flickered, needles twitching like nervous animals. Katherine felt it too. Her hand tightened on the armrest.

"Chris?"

"I see it," he said, already adjusting course.

Then the sky _opened_.

Light; impossible light; split the darkness. Not lightning. Not fire. Something cleaner. Cold. Precise. It didn't roar. It _arrived_.

Scott's breath caught.

Above them, silhouetting against the stars, was a shape that didn't belong to Earth. Angular. Regal. Alive in a way machines weren't supposed to be.

A spacecraft.

Before Christopher could react, a beam carved through the wing. No explosion. No warning. Just absence;metal gone, systems dead; gravity suddenly winning.

The plane screamed as it began to fall.

Katherine didn't scream.

She moved.

Training, instinct, love; whatever it was, it overrode fear. She grabbed the parachute. One. Only one. Christopher shouted her name, already knowing what she'd decided.

"No time," she said. Calm. Terrifyingly calm. "Chris, hold her steady."

The aircraft lurched again.

Scott felt hands on his shoulders.

"Mom?"

Her face was close now. Too close. Framed by flashing red lights and stars sliding sideways. She smiled at him, the way she did when he was scared of storms.

"You're going to be okay," she said.

She clipped the harness around Scott and Alex together; too fast, too practiced. Scott tried to protest, but the words never came. His eyes burned. A pressure behind them he didn't understand.

"Protect your brother," Katherine whispered.

Then she pushed.

The night swallowed them.

Wind tore at Scott's face as the parachute snapped open violently. Alex was screaming. Scott couldn't hear himself at all. The stars spun. The ground rushed up too fast.

The impact came like a hammer to his head.

Pain exploded behind Scott's eyes; white, blinding, absolute. Something inside his skull _shifted_. Broke. The world went dark.

High above, the aircraft vanished in a bloom of silent light.

And the stars went back to lying.

### One Year Later

Scott Summers woke up a year later.

Hospitals smell like metal and antiseptic, but to Scott, it smelled like _absence_. A missing year. A missing family. His body felt smaller, lighter; like something essential had been taken out while he slept.

They told him his parents were dead.

They told him his brother was alive.

They did not tell him where Alex was going.

He learned about that later, from overheard conversations and clipped sentences meant for adults. _Adopted._ _Lucky._ _Better fit._

Scott didn't feel lucky.

The headaches started soon after.

Not ordinary pain; pressure, like the world was pressing back through his eyes. Lights flickered when he was upset. Bulbs shattered. Mirrors cracked. Nurses learned not to meet his gaze directly.

Doctors argued.

Psychologists theorized.

No one had an answer.

Eventually, they stopped trying.

The orphanage in Omaha looked harmless. Red brick. White fences. Clean windows. A place where forgotten children were meant to fade quietly into adulthood.

Scott arrived with a medical file thicker than his suitcase.

He was quiet. Withdrawn. Polite.

And watched.

He didn't know why certain men lingered in hallways too long. Why some children were transferred without explanation. Why a tall man with sharp eyes and a patient smile always seemed to know _exactly_ when Scott's headaches were worst.

Nathaniel Essex called it concern.

Scott called it fear; though he didn't yet have a name for the man, or for the destiny tightening around him.

At night, Scott dreamed of falling.

Of stars tearing open.

Of light pouring out of him, unstoppable.

And somewhere, far beyond Earth, something remembered his name.

## Chapter 2: The Man Who Bet on Diamonds

By the time Scott Summers turned fourteen, he had learned one rule that never failed:

**Do not stand out.**

In foster care, standing out meant questions. Questions led to files. Files led to men who watched too closely.

So Scott stayed quiet.

He kept his head down. He took notes. He learned how to disappear in rooms full of people. He worked odd jobs after school, never asked for help, never complained about the headaches that came every evening like clockwork.

By then, the pain behind his eyes had become routine.

It started as pressure; dull, manageable. Then came the light sensitivity. Streetlamps hurt. Fluorescent bulbs felt sharp. By night, he sat in darkness; palms pressed to his eyes, teeth clenched, counting breaths.

Scott didn't know it yet, but **his mutation was waking up**.

The placement with **Jack Winters** wasn't an accident.

The paperwork said _an independent contractor_. _Low-risk foster_. _Temporary arrangement_. It didn't mention the criminal record, the aliases, or the fact that Jack Winters; known in certain circles as **Jack** **O'Diamonds;** had been quietly operating under the protection of a private genetic research benefactor for years.

Nathaniel Essex preferred intermediaries.

Jack lived outside **Omaha**, in a half-abandoned industrial district where nobody asked questions and nobody cared about noise. He wasn't cruel in obvious ways. He didn't hit Scott. He didn't yell.

He just watched.

Winters asked strange questions over dinner.

"How bad are the headaches today?"

"Lights bother you more lately?"

"You ever feel like something's _trying to get out_?"

Scott answered carefully.

What he didn't know was that Jack filed weekly reports.

Encrypted. Precise. Always sent east.

The first time Scott saw a specialist, it wasn't out of kindness.

Winters drove him to **Washington, D.C.**, citing "old connections." The doctor's office was quiet, sterile, funded far better than it should have been. The man who examined Scott didn't introduce himself beyond a last name. He didn't ask about family history.

He only tested reactions.

Light exposure. Focus. Dilation.

When Scott cried out in pain, the doctor didn't apologize.

Instead, he smiled.

"Fascinating."

Ruby quartz lenses were the solution; thin, precise, and rare. The doctor explained it as neurological sensitivity. A trauma response. Nothing more.

The pain eased instantly.

For the first time in years, Scott could look at the world without flinching.

Jack Winters nodded like he'd won a bet.

The eruption came three weeks later.

A construction site near the rail yard. Steel cranes cutting through the sky. Scott had taken a delivery job; cash, no questions.

The headache hit without warning.

Not pain this time, pressure. Immense. Violent. The air itself seemed to strain around him. His vision turned red, not with color but with force; something aligned, focused, screaming to be released.

Scott staggered.

His glasses slipped.

The world broke.

A beam of concussive force tore from his eyes, slamming into the crane's arm like a battering ram. Metal screamed. Bolts sheared. The payload; a massive steel container; detached and began to fall.

People screamed.

Scott didn't think.

He _acted_.

He looked up and fired again.

The blast caught the container midair and disintegrated it into scrap, scattering harmlessly across the site. The crowd lived because Scott Summers chose to save them.

But fear doesn't care about intent.

They saw a boy with glowing eyes.

They saw destruction.

They saw a monster.

"HE DID IT ON PURPOSE!"

"GET HIM!"

"DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE!"

Scott ran.

Sirens wailed in the distance as he vaulted fences, vision blurring, glasses barely holding. He didn't look back when he reached the rail yard. He jumped onto the first moving freight train he saw and held on as the city disappeared behind him.

Jack Winters watched the news that night.

He didn't call the police.

He made a phone call.

"Yes," Jack said calmly. "It finally manifested."

A pause.

"No," he added. "He survived."

Another pause.

Jack smiled.

Somewhere far away, **Nathaniel Essex** updated a file that had been waiting for years.

**Subject: Summers, Scott.**

**Status: Confirmed.**

**Next Phase: Acquisition.**

And on a train headed into the dark, a terrified teenager with burning eyes had no idea that he had just stepped off the path meant to break him; and onto one that would turn him into a weapon.

---

## Chapter 3: The Weight of Control

Jack Winters found Scott three days later.

Freight trains were predictable. Teenagers were not, but fear made them careless. Scott hadn't slept. The headaches were back, worse now that he knew what they meant. Every blink felt like pressure against a dam that might break again.

Winters didn't raise his voice when he caught up to him.

"Kid," he said calmly, stepping out from behind a boxcar. "You scared the hell out of some people."

Scott froze.

"You didn't call the cops," Scott said. It wasn't a question.

Jack smiled. "No. I called _family_."

He took Scott back.

The abuse didn't start with fists.

It started with **expectations**.

"You did it once," Jack said, pacing the room. "You can do it again."

Scott shook his head. "I don't control it."

Jack slapped him.

Not hard. Not yet.

"Try."

Scott refused.

The second hit knocked him to the floor.

Winters was methodical. He didn't rage. He _corrected_. Pain was leverage. Fear was structure. And when Scott curled inward, hands over his eyes, Jack leaned close and whispered:

"They built you for this, kid. Don't pretend you're better than what you are."

Scott cried that night, face buried in his pillow so the neighbors wouldn't hear.

The jobs escalated quickly.

Breaking safes. Disabling vehicles. Controlled destruction; always from a distance, always with Scott wearing the glasses. Jack didn't care about the headaches afterward. He cared about results.

Scott learned to aim.

He hated himself for how quickly it came.

Each blast felt like tearing something loose inside his chest. Each success made it harder to pretend he was still just a boy who wanted to be left alone.

And somewhere in the quiet moments between jobs, Scott began to feel something else.

A presence.

Like being watched; not with eyes, but with _thought_.

Charles Xavier felt Scott Summers like a scream in the dark.

It wasn't the power alone; it was the _pain_. A mind under siege, braced against itself, desperately holding back something catastrophic. Xavier had sensed mutants before. This was different.

This was a boy being broken on purpose.

Xavier didn't act alone.

Fred Duncan didn't believe in mutants.

Not really.

He believed in files. In patterns. In unexplained destruction following the same missing teenager across state lines. He believed in the kind of coincidences that stopped being coincidences after the third incident.

When Xavier approached him, Duncan almost laughed.

When Xavier described the boy; his age, his fear, his location; Duncan stopped smiling.

They made a deal.

Xavier would find the mind.

Duncan would get them through the door.

Winters was mid-lecture when it happened.

Scott felt the presence again; stronger this time. Gentle. Steady.

_"You're not alone."_

Scott gasped.

The room shook as an uncontrolled pulse cracked the far wall. Jack spun, furious.

"What did I tell you-"

The door exploded inward.

Duncan moved fast, gun raised, shouting commands. Winters reached for Scott, grabbing his collar-

And Xavier spoke.

Not aloud.

_"Let him go."_

Jack froze.

His hand trembled. His thoughts scattered like glass under pressure. Years of conditioning, greed, and borrowed confidence collapsed in on themselves. He staggered back, screaming as memories he'd buried clawed their way up.

Scott collapsed to his knees.

Xavier crossed the room slowly and knelt in front of him.

Scott looked up through tears, terrified.

"I can't stop it," Scott whispered. "I hurt people."

Xavier met his gaze without flinching.

"No," he said softly. "You saved them. And you've been saving yourself ever since."

Duncan cuffed Winters as police sirens approached.

Scott didn't notice.

For the first time in his life, someone wasn't afraid of his eyes.

They left before dawn.

Scott sat in the passenger seat, hands folded tight in his lap, afraid to look out the window. Afraid of what might come next.

Xavier didn't promise answers.

He promised **choice**.

"There is a place," he said gently, "where people like you learn control, not suppression. Where your power doesn't define your worth."

Scott swallowed.

"Will it stop hurting?"

Xavier smiled sadly. "Eventually."

The car disappeared down the road as the sun rose.

And somewhere, far away, a man named Nathaniel Essex learned that his most promising subject had slipped through his fingers.

For now.

## Chapter 4: Force Without Flame

### Lab, inside Xavier's mansion

Scott hated examination rooms.

They all smelled the same; sterile, metallic, and impersonal. Places where people looked _at_ him instead of listening.

Hank McCoy worked methodically, running scanners along Scott's temples, checking reflexes, posture, and balance. No rush. No judgment.

"Any dizziness?" Hank asked.

Scott nodded. "Sometimes. Mostly when the pressure builds."

"Head trauma history?"

"Yes."

Hank glanced briefly at Charles, then continued.

The readings made no sense.

Neurologically, Scott was stable. Physically, he was healthy. Yet every time Hank adjusted the light levels, the instruments spiked; energy signatures surging far beyond what Scott's body should be capable of producing.

Finally, Hank stepped back.

"You're not injured," he said carefully. "But something is… misaligned."

Scott exhaled, disappointed despite himself.

"So I _should_ be able to stop it," he said quietly.

Charles, seated nearby, folded his hands.

"No," he said. "The part of the brain that regulates ocular output, focus, dampening, voluntary restraint; it's been damaged," Hank said. "Not destroyed. But disconnected, due to the head injury you took when you were young. It occurred _before_ your mutation fully manifested."

Scott exhaled slowly, disappointment settling in like weight.

Charles, seated nearby, folded his hands, and noticed the child's discouragement.

"We'll figure something out," he added gently. "I promise. You are not broken, Scott. You were injured."

A beat.

"And injuries can be compensated for."

Scott nodded

### Next day, Garden outside the mansion

The next morning, they took Scott outside.

The grounds were quiet; trees swaying gently, the air cool and forgiving. Hank set up instruments at a safe distance while Charles positioned himself beside Scott.

An apple sat on a crate in front of him.

Charles gestured toward it.

"Remove your glasses," he said. "And fire when you're ready."

Scott hesitated.

His hands shook as he slid the frames off.

The pressure hit instantly, like a dam cracking open.

He fired.

The blast tore free with violent force, throwing Scott backward as if he'd been struck. The beam veered wildly, slicing past the apple.

Hank moved without thinking, stepping in front of Charles as the blast tore into a nearby tree.

Scott clenched his jaw, forcing focus.

He redirected.

The beam slammed fully into the tree's trunk; _not burning_, not melting, but _shattering_ it apart like a battering ram. Bark exploded outward. Wood splintered.

Scott squeezed his eyes shut.

Silence followed.

Hank stared at his charts.

Then at the tree.

Then back at the charts again.

"There's no thermal residue," Hank said slowly. "No charring. No heat distortion."

Charles looked thoughtful. "Then it isn't heat-based at all."

Hank nodded. "It's pure kinetic force. Concussive. Directed."

He paused, eyes narrowing at the data.

"And it doesn't appear to be originating _from_ Scott's body."

Charles turned to him.

"Then where is it coming from?"

Neither of them answered.

Charles broke the silence gently. "For now, Scott, do not remove your glasses again."

Scott nodded immediately. "Yes, sir."

Hank clapped his hands once. "Go to your room. Tomorrow, you'll begin classes."

Scott nodded again and turned away.

The hallway was quiet.

Scott moved quickly, eager to be alone, eyes downcast. He didn't see the girl turning the corner until they collided.

Books flew.

Scott stumbled and dropped to the floor instinctively; eyes squeezed shut.

"I'm sorry," he said quickly, hands searching blindly. "I... my glasses-"

The books stopped midair.

They hovered for half a second, unnatural, precise, before settling gently back into a neat stack.

Scott froze.

"Watch where you're going," the girl said, more startled than annoyed.

Scott's hand brushed the floor.

Something touched his fingers and pressed lightly into his palm.

"There," she said. "Your glasses."

He slipped them on immediately.

"Thank you," he said, standing. He didn't linger. Didn't stare. Didn't ask questions.

He walked away.

The girl watched him go.

Something about him felt… loud. Not in sound; but presence. Like pressure just beneath the surface.

She picked up her books and turned toward her classroom.

Still curious.

Still thinking about the boy who wouldn't look at her; even when he finally could.

---

## Chapter 5: Discipline

Scott thrived in classes.

Mathematics.

Physics.

Tactical theory.

Ethics.

History.

He absorbed structure like oxygen. Where his life had been chaotic, learning was orderly and predictable. Systems had rules. Problems had solutions.

He asked precise questions.

He took meticulous notes.

He never showed off.

Jean Grey sat two rows ahead of him.

She noticed anyway.

She was brilliant; effortlessly so. Concepts clicked for her before the instructor finished explaining them. But where Scott was methodical, Jean was intuitive. She didn't _calculate_ the outcomes. She felt them.

One afternoon, after class, she waited for him by the door.

"You diagram everything," she said.

Scott paused. "It helps me see outcomes."

Jean smiled faintly. "I feel the outcomes. I still have to learn how to explain them."

They walked together; not close, not awkward. Just aligned.

### **Training Room**

The visor arrived on the fourth day.

Hank didn't present it ceremoniously. He placed it on the table in front of Scott like a tool; because that's what it was.

Ruby-quartz composite.

Adjustable aperture.

External modulation controls.

"This isn't a solution," Hank said. "It's a bridge."

Scott lifted it carefully. Heavier than his glasses. Solid. Real.

"It channels the force instead of blocking it," Hank continued. "You don't suppress your power. You shape it."

Scott nodded, absorbing every word.

"For now," Hank added, "you'll train during daylight hours; before and after classes. Your body stabilizes better when ambient energy is available. Sunlight reduces neural strain, limits fatigue, and-" he glanced at the chart "-dramatically reduces your headaches."

Scott blinked. "So I'm not imagining that it feels easier outside."

"You're not," Hank said. "Your body borrows balance from the environment. Starving it only makes things worse."

That, more than anything, made Scott feel seen.

### **Outside the Mansion**

Charles introduced Bishop without ceremony.

"This is Lucas Bishop," he said. "A veteran. A survivor. And someone who understands what it means to live with power that can't be turned off."

Bishop studied Scott; posture, stance, breathing.

"You want control," Bishop said. "Then you need strength. Not just here." He tapped Scott's visor. "Everywhere."

Scott straightened instinctively.

Charles continued, "Your limitation isn't moral or mental, Scott. It's physical. To overcome it, you must build a body capable of compensating for it."

He placed a hand on Scott's shoulder.

"Training will give you what instinct cannot."

Scott nodded. "I understand, sir."

The physical training was relentless.

Mornings began before sunrise.

Running, long distance, uphill, timed.

Core conditioning, planks, holds, balance drills.

Strength training, functional, not aesthetic.

Bishop never allowed sloppy form.

"You don't brace," Bishop said once, correcting Scott's stance mid-push-up. "You _anchor_. Difference matters."

Scott learned quickly.

Not because he was stronger, but because he listened.

They trained with weights, resistance bands, and bodyweight exercises designed to reinforce postural stability. Every movement tied back to recoil control.

"Your blast throws you because you let it," Bishop said. "If You fire like you're standing still, you won't be."

They trained while moving.

Forward.

Backward.

Lateral.

Fire.

Recover.

Move.

Scott fell more times than he could count.

He got up every time.

The training room was unforgiving.

Metal walls.

Moving targets.

Timers.

Pressure.

Scott failed repeatedly.

His early blasts were too strong. Too wide. Overcorrections rattled the room. His stance collapsed under recoil more than once.

Bishop stepped in.

"Feet apart," he said, tapping Scott's heel with his boot. "You're firing like a cannon. You need to anchor."

Scott adjusted.

"Again."

The blast was cleaner.

"Again."

Better.

Bishop didn't smile. He never did. But he nodded.

"You don't hesitate," Bishop said. "That's good. Fear slows soldiers. Discipline keeps them alive."

Scott trained until his arms trembled; not from firing, but from holding himself steady.

Every session ended the same way.

Exhausted.

Focused.

Hungry to improve.

That night, Scott sat alone at his desk, visor resting beside his books.

The headaches were gone.

The fear wasn't.

But for the first time, fear had boundaries.

Control wasn't instinct.

It was discipline.

Education.

Trust.

And Scott Summers was learning all three.

The next day, the exercise was simple.

Jean stood across the room, hurling objects at random; metal discs, weighted cubes, and erratic trajectories. No pattern. No warning.

Scott stood centered.

Visor down.

The first object shattered midair.

The second ricocheted off a controlled deflection.

The third never reached him.

Jean increased speed.

Scott adjusted output, tight, precise, and minimal force.

No excess.

No panic.

No wasted energy.

Jean stopped. She studied the air where the last object had been.

"You don't overpower," she said. "You calculate."

Scott lowered the visor. "You don't telegraph."

A beat.

Mutual understanding.

They reset.

Days passed like this.

Training.

Classes.

Repetition.

Scott grew stronger. Sharper. More certain. His control improved; not because the power weakened, but because _he_ stabilized.

In team simulations, leadership came naturally.

"Split left."

"Draw them forward."

"Now."

They listened.

Not because he demanded it.

Because he was right.

When the exercise ended, Bishop reviewed the footage in silence.

Finally, he looked at Scott.

"You lead without shouting," he said. "That's rare."

Scott didn't know what to say.

So he didn't say anything.

---

## Chapter 6: The Reason We Stand

### 1998

Time has passed.

Not in moments of crisis, but in routine. Seasons changed. Lessons deepened. Training refined itself into instinct. The mansion stopped feeling like a refuge and began to feel like a headquarters.

Scott Summers graduated at the top of his class.

Jean Grey graduated beside him.

There were no ceremonies. No applause. Just acknowledgment and expectation.

Charles gathered them in the lower hangar.

The room was vast, dimly lit, humming with restrained power. Scott stood straight, hands behind his back. Jean leaned forward slightly, curiosity already pulling her ahead of the moment. Hank adjusted his glasses, eyes flicking across consoles he had helped design.

Charles didn't waste time.

"There are places," he began, "where injustice thrives not because it is powerful, but because it is ignored."

He turned his chair slowly, meeting each of their eyes.

"Mutants being exploited. Used. Disappearing quietly. Unethical experiments. Covert operations. Situations too small, too hidden, or too politically inconvenient for the world to acknowledge."

Scott understood immediately.

"Places where no one is watching," he said.

Charles nodded. "Exactly."

Jean crossed her arms. "And we are."

"You will act," Charles corrected. "Not as soldiers. Not as symbols. But as a response."

He gestured toward the far end of the hangar.

Lights came up.

The aircraft rested there like a promise.

Sleek. Black. Impossible.

Jean's breath caught. "Is that-"

"The Blackbird," Charles said. "Designed for speed, stealth, and range. Built to go where others cannot. Hank engineered this."

Jean smiled openly now. "You were hiding this?"

"I was waiting," Charles replied.

Scott stepped forward slowly, eyes tracing the aircraft's lines; not with awe, but with assessment.

"It's not just transport," he said. "It's an insertion platform."

Charles smiled.

They stood together beneath the Blackbird's left wing.

Hank broke the silence first. "You do realize what you're asking, Charles."

"Yes," Charles said. "That's why I asked _you_."

Jean glanced at Scott. "You're already planning."

Scott didn't deny it. "If we're intervening quietly, we need coordination. Clear objectives. No excess force."

Jean nodded once. Hank smiled faintly.

Charles watched them; three minds already aligning.

"You will not be heroes in the traditional sense," he said. "You will be questioned. Misunderstood. Sometimes unseen."

Scott met his gaze. "That's fine."

A pause.

Jean tilted her head. "So, what do we call ourselves?"

Charles considered the question carefully.

"You are not bound by the nation. Or politics. Or fear," he said. "You exist at the intersection of humanity and evolution."

He gestured to Scott. "Extraordinary discipline."

To Jean. "Extraordinary potential."

To Hank. "Extraordinary intellect."

"You are the next step," Charles finished. "And you stand together, as X-Men"

Jean smiled. "It fits."

Hank nodded. "Concise. Memorable."

Minutes later, the Blackbird's engines came alive.

Scott took the pilot seat; not because he insisted, but because everyone else stepped aside. Jean settled behind him. Hank ran final checks, fingers dancing across systems he trusted more than words.

The hangar doors opened.

Scott's hands were steady on the controls.

"Ready?" Jean asked.

Scott glanced back once.

"Yes."

The Blackbird lifted smoothly, silently, disappearing into the sky where they go towards western Africa to check irregular mutant activities.

No fanfare.

No witnesses.

Just purpose.

And somewhere far below, in places the world wasn't looking, someone was about to realize they were no longer alone.
