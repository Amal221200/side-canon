**Theme:**

_Strength without ownership. Power without permission._

## ACT I — THE BROTHER (2016)

**Arizona. Present day.**

A memorial wall. Names carved in stone.

James Proudstar stands alone.

He touches one name once.

**JOHN PROUDSTAR**

No ceremony. No prayer.

Just acknowledgment.

A groundskeeper nearby, older, Native, watches quietly.

_“He was a hero,”_ the man says.

James answers without looking away.

_“He was my brother.”_

Cut to—

### **FLASHBACK: CHILDHOOD (1996 - 2004)**

James grows up in a **modern Apache family**.

Working-class. Tight-knit. Proud.

Not isolated.

Not primitive.

Rooted.

John is already gone most of the time — military service, discipline, distance. To James, his brother isn’t a person yet.

He’s a **story**.

## ACT II — LOSS (2005)

James is **15** when the news comes.

John didn’t die in uniform.

He died as an **X-Man**.

The details are unclear.

The body never comes home.

All James knows:

- Charles Xavier recruited him
- The mission failed
- John didn’t return

James doesn’t scream.

Doesn’t break down.

But something closes.

## ACT III — AWAKENING (2005 - 2007)

Months later.

Anger turns physical.

James’ mutant powers manifest:

- inhuman strength
- enhanced durability
- reflexes too sharp to ignore

Power arrives **after** loss.

Not a gift.

A reminder.

No guidance.

No brother.

No purpose.

## ACT IV — EMMA FROST (2008 - 2011)

Emma finds him through **education**, not rescue.

A university program.

Scholarships.

Structure.

She never lies outright.

She reframes.

She tells him:

- Charles uses mutants
- The X-Men are expendable
- Power should be decisive

She gives James **language** for his resentment.

She never calls him a weapon.

She doesn’t need to.

## ACT V — THE MISSION (2011)

James is **18**.

Emma gives him a choice disguised as clarity.

A mission.

A correction.

An answer.

Kill Charles Xavier.

James reaches the school.

Sees the students.

The teachers.

The quiet order.

This isn’t a battlefield.

And suddenly, it clicks:

_Killing Charles doesn’t avenge John._

_It just makes James someone else’s weapon._

James walks away.

Not forgiven.

Not absolved.

Just done.

Emma doesn’t chase him.

She doesn’t have to.

## ACT VI — LEARNING TO LIVE (2011-2016)

James finishes his education.

Not elite.

Not prestigious.

Honest.

He studies:

- engineering
- logistics
- physical systems

He works:

- construction
- disaster cleanup
- rebuilding places no one films

For a time, he **enlists**.

Military service gives him:

- discipline
- structure
- teamwork

But also:

- orders
- hierarchies
- the feeling of being pointed again

He leaves early.

Not in anger.

In certainty.

James chooses a normal life.

## ACT VII — THE WAR RETURNS (2016)

The Sentinel War begins.

No call.

No telepathic summons.

No destiny.

Just sirens.

Screams.

Metal in the sky.

James steps forward.

Not as Thunderbird’s brother.

Not as Emma’s asset.

Not as Xavier’s soldier.

As a man who knows what happens when no one does.

### **THE CITY**

He fights alongside strangers:

- **Sunspot**, burning bright and unsure
- **Gambit**, detached but staying anyway
- **Spider-Man**, choosing responsibility without permission

James protects civilians.

Holds ground.

Takes hits meant for others.

He is restrained — not because he’s weak,

but because one wrong move could kill someone.

When Spider-Man saves the child James couldn’t reach—

James doesn’t feel replaced.

He feels relief.

## ACT VIII — THE NAME (2016)

After the war.

James returns to the memorial wall.

He doesn’t add his own name.

He adds a single line beneath John’s:

**STILL STANDING**

James steps away.

Not because the past is gone.

But because it no longer owns him.

## EPILOGUE — WARPATH

Later, a quiet visit.

Not recruitment.

Not pressure.

Just acknowledgment.

James nods.

He doesn’t promise anything.

But when the world needs standing—

He’s already there.
