## Lucas Bishop

Lucas Bishop was born during 1960s.

He learned early that the world keeps score.

Lucas grew up in a neighborhood that never made the news unless something burned. His parents worked long hours, careful and quiet. His sister was louder, not reckless, just hopeful. She believed the world could be argued with if you spoke clearly enough.

Lucas learned instead to endure.

Attention, he learned, was how you lost people.

Being Black made him visible.

Being a mutant made him dangerous.

His power surfaced in moments of fear, heat without fire, force without shape. Energy bent toward him, fed him, waited for direction he didn’t yet understand. They learned to hide it. Long sleeves. Fewer words. Don’t draw attention.

## The Uniform

The military offered something simple: structure.

Lucas enlisted under a clean file and a quieter name. No powers. No anomalies. Just discipline, rules, and a uniform that made people look past him instead of through him.

It worked until it didn’t.

On a battlefield that wasn’t supposed to escalate, it did. Energy weapons. A miscalculation. Lucas absorbed the blast without thinking.

He didn’t explode.

He stood there.

The silence afterward was worse than the noise.

Someone noticed.

That someone was **William Stryker**.

## The Program

They called it research.

They called it containment.

They never called it prison.

Lucas was restrained, studied, pushed. His ability cataloged like a weapon system. They learned what he could take, how much he could store, how violently it could be returned.

They anchored a blaster to his body. Not as a choice, but as a solution, forcing his power into a shape they could aim.

He tried to escape once.

He almost made it.

That was when **Sebastian Shaw** intervened, not personally, never personally. Shaw didn’t need to touch him. He touched the world _around_ him.

Lucas’ family vanished in a single night.

His sister died without a report.

The message was clear.

Endure or lose what’s left.

Lucas surrendered.

## The Door Opens

Years later, a door opened that wasn’t supposed to.

A man stood there without armor, without guards, without fear.

“I’m not here to free you,” said **Charles Xavier**.

“I’m here to ask if you still want to live.”

Lucas didn’t answer immediately.

But he took the hand.

He fought Shaw not for vengeance, but for closure and learned that even victory doesn’t return the dead.

Afterward, he disappeared.

Hiding wasn’t cowardice. It was survival with intent.

## The Teacher (Briefly)

Years passed. The world shifted.

Charles found him again, not with a plea, but a question.

“There’s a boy,” Charles said. “Too much power. No control.”

Lucas met **Scott Summers** and recognized the look immediately: fear disguised as discipline.

He trained him without speeches.

- Breathe.
- Aim.
- Don’t apologize for surviving.

When Scott graduated, Lucas left.

But he stayed in contact. Watched from a distance. Measured growth. Counted losses. Noted that the X-Men were no longer just reacting — they were preparing.

That mattered.

## 2016 — The Docks

The Sentinels didn’t come for war.

They came for children.

Lucas felt the energy spike before the alarms sounded. He didn’t wait for permission this time.

He absorbed everything, plasma, kinetic force, the scream of machines built to erase.

He stood between the kids and the future that wanted them gone.

When the dust settled, someone asked him why he stayed.

Lucas Bishop looked at the X-Men, older now, steadier, real.

“Because running only works,” he said, “until it doesn’t.”

He didn’t disappear again.

## Epilogue

Lucas Bishop doesn’t believe the world is fair.

He believes it can be **held back**, one choice at a time.

He fights not because he expects peace —

but because children deserve the chance to argue with the world like his sister once did.

And maybe win.
