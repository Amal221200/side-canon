## First Introduction

Billions of years ago, when humanity was still closer to apes than men, **three Celestial beings** arrived on Earth-not as gods, but as scientists.

They did not come to save life.

They came to _test it_.

**Nezarr the Calculator** reshaped primitive humans into the **Eternals: -** a perfected species, frozen far ahead of natural evolution, gifted with power and immortality.

**Ziran the Tester** engineered the **Deviants**, creatures designed to protect life from extinction-level threats. But their evolution proved too rapid, too unstable. They became monsters, eventually turning against the very world they were meant to defend.

Finally, **Oneg the Prober** seeded something far more dangerous and patient-a **latent, evolving gene** buried deep within humanity. It would not awaken immediately. It would wait.

For thousands of years.

Until humanity was ready.

The result was not instant.

Records mark **17,000 BC** as the first known activation of this gene. She was **Selene Gallio**, the first mutant.

But the world was not prepared.

## **5,000 BC: Ancient Egypt**

**Sandstormers** were a group of people, a resistance against a tyrant Pharaoh Ra-Ma-Tut. Defeated by the Pharoah, the leader and hundreds of survivors fled to the edge of the kingdom of Akkaba.

There was nothing but desert as far as they could see in the middle of the night.

Then, they found a settlement where a bunch of travelers were resting, making a camp with tents and bonfires.

The Sandstormers raided the camp; travelers were mercilessly slaughtered for the supplies.

No witnesses left alive.

As the Sandstormers prepared to leave one such massacre behind, their leader **Baal** heard something unexpected.

A cry.

Far from the bodies, abandoned in the sand, lay an infant, barely alive.

His skin was gray.

Faint blue lines visible across his body.

He was starving, weak… and utterly alone.

Some saw a curse.

Others saw an omen.

When members of the clan demanded the child be left to die, **Baal killed them without hesitation**.

He lifted the infant into his arms and gave him a name:

**En Sabah Nur**

_The Seven Lights._

### Childhood of survival

En Sabah Nur was not raised.

He was **hardened**.

The Sandstormers lived in motion-raiding settlements, disappearing into the desert before dawn. En grew up among screams, firelight, and blood-stained sand. Violence was not introduced to him. It surrounded him before he could speak.

He learned early what survival demanded:

- Take what you need.
- Kill without hesitation.
- Leave nothing behind.

Baal never softened these lessons.

_"The strong survive,"_ Baal told him.

_"The weak are left to perish."_

En did not question those words.

He absorbed them.

### **Training the Child**

Before En reached manhood, his body began to change.

He endured what broke others.

Hunger, heat, wounds-none slowed him.

Baal and the Sandstormers trained him relentlessly:

- Hand-to-hand combat before adolescence
- Spears, blades, and shields soon after
- Strategy learned by watching who lived and who died

By his early teens, En fought alongside grown warriors.

By his mid-teens, he outperformed them.

Some whispered that he was cursed.

Others believed he was chosen.

En ignored both.

Strength was the only truth that mattered.

### **The Making of a Weapon**

By the age of eighteen, En Sabah Nur was no longer just a warrior.

He was **unnatural**.

His size eclipsed men twice his age. His muscles formed as if sculpted by conflict itself. Wounds healed faster. Fatigue abandoned him. Fear never came.

Under his leadership, the Sandstormers became something more than raiders.

They became a **legend of terror**.

Settlements fell.

Caravans vanished.

Armies failed to stop them.

Victory followed victory.

And with each conquest, En learned another lesson:

Civilizations were fragile.

Power decided truth.

And gods-real or imagined-always served the strong.

### **The Pharaoh Takes Notice**

Word reached the palace.

Not of Baal.

Not of the Sandstormers.

But of **a child who should not exist**.

A warrior too strong.

Too resilient.

Too successful.

To Pharaoh Ra-Ma-Tut, this was not myth.

It was **a threat**.

And for the first time since En Sabah Nur was abandoned in the desert, the world's greatest power turned its gaze toward him.

## **The Fall of the Sandstormers**

Pharaoh Ra-Ma-Tut did not send an army.

He sent a warning.

His warlord, **Ozymandias**, rode into the desert with disciplined soldiers and steel meant for slaughter. The Sandstormers fought as they always had-ferociously, desperately-but this time the tide did not turn.

They were hunted.

Cornered.

Erased.

En Sabah Nur tore through soldiers like a living weapon, but numbers and preparation overwhelmed even him. When the dust settled, the Sandstormers were gone.

Baal still breathed.

Ozymandias' blade had torn deep into him, the wound already blackening under the sun. En knelt beside his father, pressing his hands against flesh that would not heal.

Baal smiled-faint, proud, unafraid.

_"Do not rule through fear alone,"_ he said.

_"Become so strong… that people choose to bow."_

His hand slipped from En's grip.

For the first time in his life, En Sabah Nur screamed-not in rage, not in battle-but in grief.

He called out for his father until his voice broke.

Ozymandias watched from a distance.

And when En rose-bloodied, silent, eyes burning-the warlord felt something unfamiliar.

Fear.

He fled.

### The Path of Chains

En buried Baal beneath the sand.

Then he walked.

He wrapped himself in rags, smeared dust across his skin, bent his back, and entered the Pharaoh's world as a slave. Rage did not blind him. Patience guided him.

It did not take long for whispers to spread.

One slave carried what ten men could not.

One slave never collapsed.

One slave did not break.

When En lifted an entire stone block alone and climbed the structure without stopping, the lie shattered.

At the summit, Ozymandias stood waiting.

The warlord did not speak.

He struck.

The blow sent En crashing down, stone and blood falling together. Darkness took him before he hit the ground.

### The Pit

Ra-Ma-Tut did not order execution.

He ordered humiliation.

_"Throw him into the pit."_

The snakes came first-coiling, crawling, biting. Venom flooded En's body. Muscles convulsed. His heart slowed.

Then something inside him **answered**.

Bones shifted.

Muscle expanded.

Skin hardened.

The poison burned-and vanished.

En grew larger, heavier, unstoppable. Hair fell away as his body rejected weakness itself. His eyes opened, glowing with fury older than kingdoms.

The snakes struck again.

They died.

When En climbed out of the pit, drenched in blood and venom, the palace fell silent.

He stood transformed-no longer hiding, no longer human in the way they understood.

And he screamed one name.

**"RA-MA-TUT!"**

Not a plea.

Not a curse.

A declaration of war.

### The Throne of Dust

En Sabah Nur did not sneak into the royal palace.

He **walked in**.

Stone doors shattered under his hands. Guards froze where they stood-not from obedience, but disbelief. The thing approaching them did not move like a man. It moved like judgment given form.

Ra-Ma-Tut saw him from the throne.

The Pharaoh who had crushed rebellions, who had ordered villages erased, felt his breath fail him. This was not rebellion. This was not a rival.

This was something **unnatural**.

_"Kill him!"_ Ra-Ma-Tut screamed.

The guards obeyed.

Spears pierced En's body. Swords cut deep into flesh. Steel struck bone.

En did not scream.

He did not slow.

He did not even look at the wounds.

He grabbed the men who had impaled him and **crushed them**-armor, bone, and all. He ripped the spears from his body and hurled them back through ranks of soldiers, pinning men to walls like insects.

Then his hands **changed**.

Flesh reshaped.

Bones extended.

Metallic blades formed where fingers once were.

The court broke.

Men fled. Men begged. Men died screaming.

Ra-Ma-Tut watched hundreds fall, his palace turning into a slaughterhouse of blood and marble. Every attempt to stop En ended the same way-broken bodies, shattered courage.

Civilization collapsed in minutes.

## **The Naming**

En reached the throne before Ra-Ma-Tut could escape.

The Pharaoh stumbled backward, robes soaked with fear.

_"You are not a man,"_ Ra-Ma-Tut whispered.

_"You are the Apocalypse."_

En raised his blade.

He paused.

_"Maybe."_

The sword fell.

Ra-Ma-Tut died where he ruled.

## **Ozymandias**

Only one man remained standing.

Ozymandias.

The warlord who had led the slaughter of the Sandstormers.

The man who had watched Baal die.

Ozymandias attacked out of instinct, desperation, denial.

En caught him by the throat with one hand.

Something inside En responded, not rage, not intention, but **instinct**.

Energy surged.

Too much.

Ozymandias screamed as his body **hardened**, flesh turning to living stone. He did not die. He did not freeze. He could still move.

And then he **saw**.

Time unfolded before his eyes, empires rising, gods falling, worlds burning. At the center of it all stood En Sabah Nur.

Apocalypse.

Ozymandias' voice trembled.

_"The Pharaoh was right…"_

En released him.

_"You will live,"_ En said.

_"You will serve."_

Ozymandias understood the truth immediately.

This was not mercy.

This was **selection**.

And he bowed,not because he was ordered to…

but because the future demanded it.

### The Life of Apocalypse: Fragmented Phases

Not chapters.

**Ages.**

Each incomplete by design.

### PHASE I: The Awakening of Knowledge

Apocalypse wandered the world after Egypt, not as a conqueror, but as an **observer**.

During his travels, he encountered an **External,** a being guarding something ancient, dormant, and not meant for humanity.

A **Celestial vessel**.

Apocalypse killed the External without ceremony.

Not for destiny.

For access.

Inside the vessel, he made contact.

Not communion.

**Disclosure.**

He learned:

- What mutants were
- That he was not unique, but _early_
- That his potential had no defined ceiling
- That evolution itself could be _guided_

The Celestials spoke of **roles**.

Apocalypse ignored them.

What interested him was **technology**.

He learned how Celestial systems worked, how they amplified biology rather than replacing it. Using this knowledge, he forged his first armor: not protection, but **augmentation**.

Here, he tested himself deliberately:

- Energy manipulation
- Shapeshifting
- Teleportation
- Telekinesis
- Telepathy

Not to show dominance, but to **measure limits**.

He brought the vessel to Egypt, buried it beneath stone and myth, and sealed it beneath a monument humanity would misunderstand forever.

A **Sphinx**.

Civilization built symbols.

Apocalypse built foundations.

### PHASE II: Bloodlines and Belief

Apocalypse did not build empires.

He built **selection systems**.

He created the **Dark Riders,** enforcers, not generals. Instruments of testing, not conquest.

From them came **Clan Akkaba**.

Not followers.

**Descendants.**

Blood mattered, not for purity, but for **data**. Apocalypse wanted to see how strength evolved through lineage, how ideology mutated when inherited.

This phase teaches him a limitation:

Strength can be diluted.

Belief can rot.

Blood alone was not enough.

### PHASE III: Okkara and the Cost of Survival

Apocalypse found something rare.

An equal.

On the living island **Okkara**, he settled with **Genesis;** not as a ruler, but as a builder. Together they created a civilization defined not by fear, but by readiness.

They had four children:

- **Pestilence**
- **War**
- **Famine**
- **Death**

He did not name them after concepts.

He named them after **outcomes**.

He called them his Horsemen, not as weapons, but as _principles_.

Then came **Amenth**.

Demons from the Dark Dimension did not invade for conquest. They invaded to consume.

The war shattered Okkara.

The island was split:

- **Arakko**, sealed away into Amenth with its warriors
- **Krakoa**, left behind with Apocalypse

This is the first time Apocalypse **has lost something permanent**.

Not a battle.

A future.

And he learns something new:

Even strength has limits when it stands alone.

### PHASE IV: The Sleeper Who Watches

Apocalypse entered long cycles of hibernation.

Not retreat.

**Calibration.**

Using the Celestial vessel, now hidden beneath the Sphinx, he slept through ages. Ozymandias slept elsewhere, sealed with the Opal, preserving foresight.

Each awakening placed Apocalypse in a new civilization.

He did not intervene openly.

He watched:

- Rome rise and fall
- Alexander burn the world too fast
- Empires fracture under their own weight
- In ancient China, he observed the **Mandarin**, wielding ten rings, proof that power could exist without evolution

Apocalypse did not cause these wars.

He **let them happen**.

And noted who survived.

Who adapted.

Who failed.

Any potential candidates to be his Horsemen.

### PHASE V: The Essex Variable

Apocalypse entered **Essex's lab** unseen.

He did not introduce himself.

He did not correct him.

He observed a man obsessed with eliminating weakness, not through dominance, but **preservation**.

Interesting.

Apocalypse altered the samples slightly.

Not enough to control the outcome.

Enough to see what humanity would do with power.

When Essex returned, Apocalypse was gone.

The formula worked.

Essex drank it, not for ambition, but for love. For his wife. For a child he feared losing.

Apocalypse never judged him.

He simply **recorded the result**.

### PRESENT: The Hum Beneath the Sand

Now, Apocalypse sleeps again.

Inside the Celestial vessel.

Machines humming.

Systems waiting.

Not dreaming.

**Listening.**

Because evolution is loud when it accelerates.

And when the world is ready, or fragile enough-

He will wake.
