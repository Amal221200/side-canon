## Chapter One — Bringing the Animal

### 2005. Northern Canada.

The forest felt older than memory.

Pine needles carpeted the ground in damp silence. Snow clung to the higher ridges where the sun barely reached. No wind. No birds. Just the slow, patient breath of wilderness.

Three figures moved through it carefully.

They were young — mid-twenties at most — but there was nothing careless about them.

**Cyclops** walked point, posture straight, visor dim but ready. His boots pressed clean lines into the soil. He scanned ahead with disciplined precision.

Behind him, **Jean Grey** moved lighter, quieter — her brow faintly furrowed. She wasn’t just listening to the forest.

She was listening to something inside it.

To their right, **Storm** stepped with almost ceremonial calm. The air around her felt aware, as if the weather itself was holding its breath.

Scott broke the silence first.

“Anything?”

Jean slowed. Closed her eyes.

“There’s… something.” Her voice was low. “Not clear. Not structured. It’s not thinking the way we think.”

Storm’s eyes drifted to the treeline.

“Animal?”

Jean hesitated.

“Not exactly.”

They moved deeper.

The smell hit first.

Metallic. Fresh.

Scott raised a hand. They stopped.

Ahead, through broken brush and shattered bark, lay what remained of two men.

Not mauled.

Sliced.

Clean, brutal precision.

Trees around them bore parallel gouges — three at a time — sunk deep into solid wood.

Storm crouched beside one body, examining the cuts.

“No ordinary predator did this.”

Scott’s visor flickered faintly brighter.

Jean froze.

Her breath caught.

“It knows we’re here.”

Scott turned slightly. “Direction?”

Jean swallowed. “Everywhere.”

The growl came low — distant, vibrating through the trees like something ancient remembering hunger.

A shape shifted between trunks.

Then stepped forward.

Hair matted. Beard wild. Shoulders broad beneath torn remnants of fabric long decayed into rags. Blood streaked across his arms. His posture low — coiled.

Not a man standing upright.

A predator assessing distance.

His eyes locked on them.

There was no language in them.

Only calculation.

Scott’s visor glowed brighter.

“Easy,” Jean whispered.

Too late.

The feral figure lunged.

He moved impossibly fast — low, controlled, explosive. Not reckless. Tactical.

Scott fired.

A crimson beam tore through the trees and struck the charging figure mid-air, blasting him backward through bark and splintered wood.

He hit hard.

And rose immediately.

Three metallic claws snapped out from each fist with a sound like sharpened steel tearing through bone.

Storm inhaled sharply.

“Metal…”

The man charged again.

Jean reached outward — not forcefully, but carefully — touching the storm inside his mind.

What she felt made her shudder.

Noise.

Fragmented instinct.

Pain layered over pain.

A name buried too deep to reach.

She pushed gently.

Sleep.

The man staggered mid-stride, claws still extended, eyes fighting against a fog descending over him.

For a moment, he looked almost… confused.

Then he collapsed.

The forest returned to silence.

Scott kept his visor trained, chest rising and falling steadily.

Storm approached cautiously.

The claws slowly retracted with a wet metallic whisper.

Up close, they could see it clearly now — the metal fused seamlessly to bone.

Scott muttered, almost to himself, “What kind of thing is that?”

Jean knelt beside the unconscious figure. Her hand hovered over his temple.

“He’s not a thing.”

She glanced up at Scott.

“He’s broken.”

Storm watched as the deep burn from Scott’s blast began to knit itself together before their eyes — flesh sealing, skin restoring.

Healing.

Rapid. Unnatural.

Scott lowered his visor slightly.

“We can’t leave him here.”

Storm nodded once.

“Whatever he is… someone made him this way.”

Scott didn’t like it.

Bringing an unknown, violently unstable mutant back to the mansion went against every protocol instinct in him.

But he looked at Jean.

At the faint tremor in her hand as she kept the mind subdued.

And he made the call.

“Jean, keep him under. As long as you can.”

She nodded.

Storm lifted the man effortlessly, wind curling subtly beneath him to ease the weight.

Scott took one last look at the gouged trees — the brutal efficiency of the cuts.

This wasn’t random savagery.

This was training without memory.

Without restraint.

They moved back through the trees toward the clearing where the Blackbird waited, engines silent against the sky.

Behind them, the forest exhaled again.

Unaware that something older than its silence had just been removed.

And somewhere far below the surface of the sleeping man’s mind —

A buried fragment stirred.

Not instinct.

Not rage.

A word.

Unformed.

Waiting.

### Night. Xavier’s Mansion. Medical Wing.

The mansion was quiet in the way only old houses could be.

Floorboards settled. Wind traced the windows. Somewhere far off, a clock chimed.

Inside the medical lab, fluorescent light hummed softly over a metal table.

The man from the forest lay still.

No longer caked in blood and dirt.

His body had been cleaned. The worst of the tangled hair trimmed back. Beard shaped but still rugged — more of a wolf than a gentleman. Muscles defined beneath pale skin now free of grime. For someone who survived in wilderness, there wasn’t a single scar on him, not one mark to prove he had ever been wounded.

The adamantium claws were retracted.

But everyone in the room understood they were not gone.

At the far end stood **Beast**, adjusting instruments with careful precision.

Beside him, composed and watchful, was **Professor X**.

Charles’ eyes were closed.

Not asleep.

Working.

### **Inside Logan’s Mind**

Charles moved carefully.

He did not force memories.

He did not unlock the past.

He searched for cognition — language centers long dormant, neural pathways buried beneath trauma and isolation.

He reconnected what had withered:

Speech.

Comprehension.

Emotional processing.

Enough.

Only enough.

And then—

Pain surged.

Explosions.

Gunfire.

Snow stained red.

A lab.

Restraints.

Screaming.

Metal bonding to bone.

The man on the table convulsed.

His heartbeat spiked.

Claws burst outward with a metallic _SNIKT_ as he jolted upright—

Screaming.

Not rage.

Agony.

### **Awakening**

In one fluid motion he spun, crouched low on the table, claws extended, breathing ragged.

Predator stance.

Eyes wild.

He locked onto Charles.

Then Hank.

Assessing.

Distance.

Threat.

Escape routes.

“Where… did you bring me?” His voice was rough, unused, scraping out of his throat like gravel.

Charles remained calm.

“You are in a safe place.”

The man’s nostrils flared slightly.

Safe was not a word his body believed.

Hank raised his hands slowly.

“What is your name?”

A pause.

As if searching through fog.

“…Logan.”

The word came instinctively.

“…Wolverine.”

The claws twitched slightly as he said it.

Charles inclined his head.

“Do you remember anything else, Logan?”

Logan tried.

His brow tightened.

Flashes—

Snow.

Hunting.

Cold.

Survival.

But nothing before that.

His jaw clenched.

“…Just staying alive.”

His gaze sharpened suddenly.

“Funny thing is… I can talk.”

He looked between them.

“And I understand you.”

His eyes narrowed at Charles.

“What did you do to me?”

Charles met his stare evenly.

“We restored what was dormant. Language. Processing. Nothing more.”

Hank added gently,

“You were wandering alone for a long time. Your memories were severely compromised.”

Logan’s breathing steadied — but his body remained coiled.

His eyes shifted toward a reflective surface across the lab.

He saw himself.

Cleaner.

Sharper.

Different.

He ran a hand over his shorter hair, jaw tightening.

Hank offered an awkward half-smile.

“Necessary hygiene. We kept the… aesthetic.”

Logan didn’t smile back.

The lab doors slid open.

### **The Team**

Scott entered first — posture straight, controlled.

Behind him, Jean. Calm, observant.

Storm moved with measured grace.

And trailing slightly behind them, curious but cautious, was **Rogue** — Anna Marie — still young, still learning.

Charles gestured lightly.

“They are the ones who found you.”

He introduced them calmly.

“Scott Summers. Jean Grey. Ororo Munroe.”

A small nod toward Rogue.

“And Anna Marie. She is still finding her place here.”

Logan’s eyes moved from face to face.

Measuring.

Noticing youth.

Mid-twenties, at most.

But not inexperienced.

Scott crossed his arms slightly.

Jean watched Logan’s breathing pattern.

Storm held his gaze — steady, unafraid.

Charles continued,

“We brought you here so you could learn to live again. Not as a weapon. Not as a beast.”

A slight pause.

“As one of us.”

Logan’s expression hardened.

“Well, I don’t need help from any shelter service.”

He swung his legs off the table and stood.

No hesitation.

No gratitude.

He pushed past Scott and Ororo’s shoulder roughly on his way toward the exit.

Scott stiffened instantly.

“I don’t like his attitude.”

Charles did not react.

“Nor did I expect you to.”

Logan paused briefly at the doorway — just long enough to scan the hallway layout instinctively.

Then he disappeared into the mansion.

Charles folded his hands.

“Give him time.”

Jean exhaled slowly.

“There’s so much pain in there.”

Storm nodded quietly.

“He is not lost.”

Scott frowned slightly.

“Feels like he wants to be.”

Charles’ voice was gentle but firm.

“No. He wants to survive.”

A subtle difference.

The camera would linger on the empty doorway where Logan exited.

Somewhere down the corridor, faint footsteps echo.

A man who remembered only survival…

Now standing in a place offering belonging.

And not knowing what to do with it.

### Scene Direction: The First Night Outside

Logan doesn’t storm off angrily.

He moves.

Silently.

Purposefully.

He’s not wandering — he’s mapping.

### **Exterior – Mansion Grounds – Night**

The doors open.

Cool air hits his face.

He pauses.

Breathes.

For the first time since waking, there’s no fluorescent light.

No metal.

No restraints.

Just sky.

He steps forward.

The mansion grounds stretch wide — manicured lawns, tall trees, distant stone pathways.

To the right—

Light spills from another building.

Laughter.

Young voices.

He turns instinctively.

Across the field, students — teenagers — are finishing some late evening activity. A few still tossing a ball. A couple arguing. One floating briefly before landing clumsily.

Normal chaos.

Logan watches.

Not with warmth.

With confusion.

He studies them the way he studied prey earlier.

Except now… there’s no threat posture.

Just observation.

He senses it before he hears it.

**Professor X** rolls beside him, stopping at a respectful distance.

“Peaceful, isn’t it?”

Logan doesn’t look at him.

“Too quiet.”

Charles smiles faintly.

“That is often what peace sounds like.”

Logan studies the students again.

“They don’t look like they’re hiding.”

“They aren’t.”

“Why?”

Charles considers the answer carefully.

“Because here, they do not have to.”

Silence settles between them.

Logan shifts his weight slightly, scanning the tree line out of habit.

“You picked me up like some stray.”

Charles does not deny it.

“You were surviving. Not living.”

That lands.

Logan’s jaw tightens.

“What’s the difference?”

Charles gestures subtly toward the school building.

“Survival is instinct. Living is choice.”

Another pause.

“You are lost, Logan. And frightened.”

Logan turns sharply.

“I’m not afraid.”

Charles meets his stare calmly.

“Of course you are. Anyone who has been caged would be.”

That disarms him more than confrontation would.

Charles continues, voice steady.

“If you leave tonight, I will not stop you. But the world beyond these gates is not kind to men who carry metal in their bones.”

Logan says nothing.

“You may stay,” Charles adds. “Learn about us. About what we protect. About what you could protect.”

Wind stirs lightly across the lawn.

Laughter echoes again from the school building.

Logan watches a young mutant accidentally float a few feet off the ground before stumbling back down. The others cheer.

No fear.

No hunting.

No blood.

He doesn’t understand the word peaceful.

But he recognizes the absence of threat.

That… soothes something deep and unfamiliar.

Finally, he speaks.

“For how long?”

Charles answers simply:

“As long as you need.”

A long beat.

Logan nods once — not agreement, not gratitude.

Just decision.

“I’ll stay.”

Not forever.

Not committed.

Just… for now.

Charles inclines his head.

“That is enough.”

They sit in silence a moment longer.

Logan still scans the perimeter.

But his shoulders lower — just slightly.

For the first time in years, he is not calculating escape.

He is choosing to remain.

---

## Chapter Two — Recalibration

The mansion did not feel like a prison.

That unsettled him more than steel ever had.

Days passed.

Logan moved through halls lined with paintings and polished floors like a predator inside a museum. Students stared when he walked by. Some pretended not to. He noticed both.

He noticed everything.

He sat in the back of classrooms, arms folded, silent. A world map projected against the wall shifted with a click — borders different from what his bones remembered. Names changed. Nations dissolved. New ones born.

He didn’t react.

But he memorized.

In the lab, Hank explained genetic theory with enthusiastic precision. Logan listened, not because he cared about chromosomes, but because knowledge meant terrain. Terrain meant advantage.

Later, in a computer room, the low hum of desktop towers filled the air. Monitors flickered with slow-loading pages and search results.

A student mentioned researching something “online.”

Logan’s eyes shifted to the screens.

“All that information just sits there?” he asked.

“Accessible from anywhere,” Hank replied, adjusting his glasses. “With the right connection.”

Logan studied the glowing monitors.

“Feels like leaving tracks.”

A few students exchanged glances.

Hank smiled lightly. “Only if you don’t know how to cover them.”

Logan didn’t smile.

Storm noticed he preferred open windows. Jean noticed he rarely asked questions but absorbed everything. Scott noticed he ignored routine unless directly told otherwise.

He was learning.

But he was not integrating.

### The Danger Room

The metal doors sealed shut behind them with a hydraulic sigh.

Inside, the air shifted — synthetic, charged.

Scott stepped forward, leadership posture automatic.

“Simulation level three. Controlled engagement.”

Logan stood opposite them, still, unreadable.

The room dissolved.

Concrete walls rose. Smoke curled from broken streetlights. A war-torn urban block assembled itself around them in seconds.

Storm lifted slightly from the ground, wind coiling at her command.

Jean’s eyes sharpened.

Scott’s visor glowed faint red.

Logan inhaled once.

Then he moved.

### Phase One – Storm

Wind slammed toward him.

He didn’t fight it head-on.

He angled through debris, low to the ground, using overturned metal as cover. The gusts shredded what they struck — but he was never where they landed.

Storm increased pressure.

He timed it.

Closed distance between bursts.

One leap — impossibly fast — and he caught her mid-hover, twisting her gently but decisively out of balance.

She landed hard but unharmed.

Neutralized.

Storm’s eyes narrowed.

Interesting.

### Phase Two – Jean

Jean lifted him telekinetically.

Concrete cracked beneath the pressure.

Logan snarled — not in anger, but in resistance. Muscles strained. Veins stood out along his neck. He forced an arm downward inch by inch.

The claws slid out.

Metal gleamed under simulated firelight.

Jean felt it then.

A shift.

Something deeper.

Not strategy.

Instinct.

Predatory alignment.

His mind didn’t read like aggression.

It read like inevitability.

She faltered for half a second.

That was enough.

He dropped free.

### Phase Three – Cyclops

Scott fired.

A precise beam carved across the street.

Logan rolled through dust, using smoke for cover, closing distance in bursts. He tracked Scott’s rhythm. Calculated intervals between blasts.

Scott adjusted. Increased output.

Red light flashed violently across broken walls.

“Stand down!” Scott ordered.

Logan didn’t process the command.

Only threat posture.

He lunged.

A point-blank blast struck his chest and hurled him backward.

He rose instantly.

And charged again.

They collided — Scott firing, Logan weaving, claws slashing dangerously close to the visor’s edge.

Scott braced.

Logan tackled him through a collapsing wall panel.

They hit the ground hard.

Claws rose.

This time—

Not sparring.

Not simulation.

Kill trajectory.

Jean felt it fully now.

That razor-thin shift where survival becomes elimination.

“Logan!”

Her voice wasn’t shouted aloud.

It cracked through his mind like lightning.

Everything froze.

His body locked mid-strike, claws inches from Scott’s visor.

The simulation dissolved instantly.

Silence filled the chamber.

### Aftermath

Scott shoved him off and stood, breathing hard.

“What is wrong with you?!”

Logan staggered back a step.

Confusion flickered across his face — real confusion.

“I don’t know.”

His voice was low.

Tight.

“This is the only way I know how to fight.”

No arrogance.

No challenge.

Just fact.

He turned and walked out before anyone could stop him.

Not running.

Not raging.

Just leaving.

### Observation Room

Scott paced.

“That’s unacceptable. He almost killed me.”

Charles watched calmly from his chair.

“You are correct.”

Scott blinked — not expecting agreement.

Charles continued.

“What you witnessed was not malice. It was conditioning.”

“He lost control.”

“He has never been taught control.”

Scott exhaled sharply.

“That’s not an excuse.”

“No,” Charles said gently. “It is an explanation.”

Storm stood quietly by the window.

Jean was still unsettled.

Charles folded his hands.

“He does not understand comfort. Or restraint. Or consequence. He survived without memory. Without structure. Without society.”

Scott looked toward the sealed doors.

“So what are we supposed to do?”

Charles’ gaze remained steady.

“Teach him.”

A pause.

“He is lost.”

Another pause.

“But not forever.”

Outside, Logan stood alone beneath the open sky.

His breathing had steadied.

But his hands still trembled faintly.

He stared at them.

At the metal hidden beneath skin.

He had won.

And it felt wrong.

For the first time since waking—

He wasn’t certain whether survival was enough.

Footsteps approached softly behind him.

He didn’t turn.

“I know you,” he said, voice low. “You were in my head. Back in the forest.”

A pause.

“Yes,” said **Jean Grey** gently. “You would have killed us.”

Logan nodded once.

“Felt like drowning. Then everything went quiet.”

“I wasn’t trying to control you,” she said. “Just… stop you.”

He accepted that without comment.

For a while, they stood in silence, looking at the night.

“I’m sorry,” Logan said finally.

Jean glanced at him. “For what?”

“For what happened in there.” He flexed his hand unconsciously, remembering the weight of claws inches from a visor. “This is the only way I know how to fight.”

The simplicity of it lands heavy.

Jean studies him.

“That’s why we are learning,” she says softly. “So we don’t become what we’re fighting.”

He swallowed, eyes still on the horizon.

“And I’m sorry for hurting him. Feels like he’s important to you.”

Jean studied him.

“How do you know that?”

Logan tilted his head slightly.

“In that room… when I went forward, and you stopped me in the air—” He searched for the right words. “It’s like, you were afraid to lose him.”

Jean’s expression softened. Not embarrassed. Not surprised.

“Was it that obvious?”

“Yeah.”

A faint smile touched her lips.

Logan looked sideways at her.

“What do you see in him?”

There was no edge in the question. Just confusion.

“He’s stubborn,” Logan continued. “Hard on everyone. Doesn’t bend.”

Jean stepped closer to the railing, hands resting on the railing.

“Scott had to grow up faster than anyone should,” she said quietly. “He’s been put in impossible situations. Forced to lead. Forced to hold back power that could destroy everything around him.”

She looked up at the stars briefly.

“He wakes up every day knowing one mistake could hurt someone he cares about.”

Logan listened.

“And he still chooses restraint,” Jean continued. “He still chooses responsibility. He trains harder than anyone. Pushes himself harder than anyone. Not because he likes control.”

A pause.

“Because he doesn’t want to fail the people who trust him.”

She turned to Logan.

“That inspires me. Not the toughness. Not the authority.”

“The discipline?”

“The choice,” Jean corrected gently. “He could be angry. He could be reckless. He could blame the world for what happened to him.”

She let that hang between them.

“But he doesn’t.”

Logan absorbed that slowly.

He thought about the way Scott stood his ground. The way the optic blasts never wavered. The way he didn’t step back even when claws were inches away.

Maybe that wasn’t stubbornness.

Maybe it was control under fear.

Jean straightened.

She started toward the door, then paused.

“You don’t fight wrong, Logan.”

He glanced at her.

“You just haven’t learned when to stop.”

She disappeared inside.

Logan remained on the balcony.

The wind moved lightly across the stone.

He looked back up at the sky.

For the first time since arriving, he wasn’t scanning for threats.

He was thinking.

Maybe he had misread Scott.

Maybe what he saw as rigidity was something harder earned.

And maybe—

Just maybe—

There was more than one way to survive

### Training Room – Late Evening

The Danger Room is dark now.

Only a single overhead light glows near the control console.

Scott stands in training gear, visor dimmed, reviewing targeting patterns on a floating holographic display. The room hums softly — calm, ordered.

The doors slide open behind him.

He doesn’t turn.

“I figured you’d come back.”

Logan steps in, hands in his pockets.

“I don’t like unfinished things.”

Scott powers down the display.

Silence stretches between them.

Logan breaks it.

“I shouldn’t have gone that far.”

Scott faces him fully now.

“You almost killed me.”

Not accusatory.

Not dramatic.

Just truth.

Logan nods.

“I don’t always know when to stop.”

That lands differently this time.

Scott studies him.

“I do.”

A beat.

“Every second of every day.”

Logan tilts his head slightly.

Scott gestures to his visor.

“If I lose focus for half a second, someone gets hurt. So I train. I measure. I calculate.”

He steps closer.

“Control isn’t optional for me.”

Logan considers that.

“For me… it wasn’t either.”

Scott’s expression shifts — understanding flickers.

“You were built to end fights.”

Logan’s jaw tightens.

“Yeah.”

Scott nods once.

“But here, ending the fight isn’t the goal.”

“What is?”

“Coming back alive. Together.”

That word hangs there.

Together.

Logan exhales slowly.

“Teach me.”

Scott doesn’t smile — but something in his posture relaxes.

“Alright.”

### Short Sparring Demonstration

Scott activates a low-level combat simulation.

No explosions.

No chaos.

Just simple movement drills.

“Distance,” Scott says. “You don’t close every gap.”

Logan lunges instinctively.

Scott sidesteps.

“See? You commit too hard.”

They circle.

Scott fires a low-output beam at Logan’s feet — forcing him to adjust rather than absorb.

“Force doesn’t always mean forward.”

Logan adapts quickly.

Learns quickly.

Scott notices.

“Good. Now stop.”

Logan hesitates — then pulls back instead of following through.

Scott nods.

“That’s it.”

For the first time, Logan looks slightly… focused instead of defensive.

### After

They both step back.

Breathing steady.

Logan wipes sweat from his brow.

“Another round?”

Scott checks the clock.

“Tomorrow.”

Logan raises an eyebrow.

Scott shrugs slightly.

“I have a morning routine.”

Logan almost smirks.

“You wake up early?”

“Six.”

“That’s not morning. That’s punishment.”

Scott finally allows the smallest hint of humor.

“It’s discipline.”

A quiet pause.

Logan nods once.

“I’ll be there.”

Scott gives him a long look.

“You don’t have to.”

Logan turns toward the exit.

“Yeah. I do.”

The doors close behind him.

Scott watches for a moment.

Then resets the room for the next day.

---

## Chapter Three — Routine

### Morning – Mansion Grounds

It’s still dark when Logan steps outside.

He hears it before he sees it.

Footsteps. Rhythmic. Measured.

Scott runs the perimeter of the estate, breath controlled, pace steady.

Logan watches from the balcony.

Six in the morning.

Scott finishes a lap and slows near the steps.

“You’re up early,” Scott says without stopping.

“Didn’t sleep much,” Logan replies.

Scott gestures to the grounds.

“Run helps.”

Logan considers it. Then drops down from the balcony instead of using the stairs.

Scott doesn’t react.

They run.

Scott’s endurance is steady and human.

Logan’s is effortless.

After several laps, Scott stops at the outdoor training rack — pull-ups, weighted presses, resistance cables.

Logan joins without being invited.

Steel bends slightly in Logan’s grip.

Scott notices.

Logan, “You’re not bad kid."

“You don’t get to say it’s not bad,” Scott says between reps. “Your muscles repair instantly.”

Logan smirks faintly.

“Still feels heavy.”

Scott almost smiles.

Almost.

### Ororo & Jean Arrive

**Storm** approaches with **Jean Grey**, both already dressed for training.

Storm observes the scene calmly.

“So you reconciled already?”

Scott shrugs.

“We reset.”

Storm steps forward, extending a hand to Logan.

“We didn’t introduce ourselves properly.”

“Ororo Munroe.”

Logan studies her grip.

Firm. Balanced.

Not defensive.

“Logan.”

Scott adds dryly:

“At least you two have something in common.”

Logan glances between them.

“Yeah?”

Scott nods toward Storm.

“Survived more wilderness than most.”

Logan looks at her again.

“You must be like… a warrior or something.”

Storm’s lips curve faintly.

“I wouldn’t go that far.”

But her posture says otherwise.

### Growing Familiarity

Days pass.

Logan starts appearing at morning training without being asked.

He watches younger students attempt drills.

He corrects foot placement without explaining why.

Scott adjusts strategies during tactical discussions.

They disagree.

Often.

Scott prefers structured formation.

Logan prefers adaptive flanking.

Storm mediates without choosing sides.

Jean listens.

Sometimes Logan is right.

Sometimes Scott is.

The team begins adjusting around each other.

### Quiet Moment – Storm & Logan

One afternoon, during free time, Storm spars with Logan under an open sky.

Wind pushes against him.

He adapts.

This time, he stops before striking.

Storm notices.

“Improvement.”

Logan shrugs.

After sparring, he sits beside her on the stone steps.

“So… what is going on with them?”

Storm glances at him sideways.

“I wish.”

Logan raises a brow.

“Jean likes him. Scott…” she exhales lightly. “Scott is many things. Perceptive is not always one of them.”

“They’ve been like that long?”

“Long before I arrived.”

Logan considers that.

“Seems complicated.”

Storm looks at him.

“Most strength is.”

A pause.

“You’ve known strength too.”

Logan doesn’t answer.

But he doesn’t leave.

### The Departure Decision

Night.

Logan’s room is sparse.

A small bag sits open on the bed.

He folds a shirt.

Slowly.

A knock.

**Professor X** enters quietly.

“So,” Charles says gently. “You’ve decided.”

Logan doesn’t look at him.

“I was never planning to stay forever.”

“I know.”

A pause.

“But we could use your support.”

Logan nods slightly.

“Thanks. For everything.”

Not sentimental.

Just honest.

Before more can be said—

An alarm cuts through the mansion.

Sharp.

Urgent.

### The Alert

Professor X arrives at the lab, followed by Logan and Anna.

**Beast** stands over the console.

“I’ve lost contact.”

Scott. Jean. Ororo.

No signal.

Last coordinates flashing.

“It’s like they never completed the extraction,” Hank mutters.

Logan feels it before anyone says it.

Something wrong.

Charles’ expression tightens.

“They are in danger.”

Silence.

Logan steps forward.

“I can help.”

Charles studies him.

“You’re certain?”

“Yes.”

Anna steps beside him.

“I’m coming too.”

Hank straightens.

“So am I.”

Logan turns slowly toward him.

Hank clears his throat.

“I do know how to fight.”

Logan nods once.

Then pauses.

Hank squints at him.

“Are you planning to go into combat wearing jeans and a leather jacket?”

Logan glances down at himself.

“You got something better?”

Hank’s eyes brighten.

“I was hoping you’d ask.”

He disappears into a side chamber and returns with a suit.

Durable. Functional. Tactical.

Logan studies it.

Brown leather panels.

Tan armor plating.

Black striping.

Compact but reinforced.

“Feels like a gimmick.”

Charles’ voice is calm.

“Everyone here wears one.”

Logan looks at the suit again, then at the team.

The alarm is still flashing.

Slowly—

He takes it.

---

## Chapter Four — Scorched Earth

Northern Canada.

Below the snowline.

Buried beneath rock and Cold War paranoia.

The bunker was older than the men running it.

Concrete corridors. Reinforced steel doors. Fluorescent lights humming over gray floors polished by boots, not time.

In a sealed holding chamber deep inside the facility—

Scott sat restrained to a steel chair, visor removed, eyes closed behind red-lensed containment glasses. His breathing was steady. Controlled. Even now.

Jean knelt nearby, wrists bound in dampening cuffs, pale but conscious. A faint psychic tremor flickered across her temples.

Storm stood upright despite her restraints, chin lifted, gaze level.

They were not broken.

They were waiting.

At the far wall, claws flexed softly.

**Lady Deathstrike** stood guard.

Her expression unreadable.

Outside the chamber, deeper in the facility, alarms pulsed in low mechanical rhythm.

The secondary infiltration had begun.

### Entry

Above ground, the auxiliary jet settled into a concealed ravine two miles from the bunker entrance.

Logan stepped into the snow first.

Brown and tan suit absorbing moonlight.

No hesitation.

Beside him, **Beast** adjusted a compact device on his wrist.

“Perimeter defenses are military grade,” Hank murmured. “Motion sensors, infrared, and something… less conventional.”

Rogue cracked her knuckles.

“Just point me where to punch.”

Logan glanced at both.

“Stick to the plan.”

Hank nodded.

“Disable systems.”

Rogue grinned.

“Neutralize guards.”

Logan’s eyes hardened.

“I’ll get them.”

They moved.

### The Split

The bunker entrance opened via concealed blast door carved into rock.

Beast slipped ahead first, vaulting over a pair of armed guards before they registered motion. One down with a precise nerve strike. The other incapacitated before firing.

No wasted movement.

He disappeared into the control corridors.

Rogue entered through a lower access hallway.

Two guards rushed her.

She moved fluidly, training evident. A spinning kick disarmed one. She grabbed the second by the collar, skin meeting skin for half a second.

His strength drained.

She shoved him aside, eyes briefly flickering with borrowed adrenaline.

At the far end of the corridor, a sniper silhouette shifted.

Agent Zero.

A shot rang out.

Rogue rolled behind steel support.

Another shot.

She lunged when he reloaded, closed the distance before he could adjust.

Her hand caught his wrist.

A surge.

His aim faltered.

She disarmed him and left him unconscious against the wall.

Extraction corridor secured.

### Beast vs Systems

Deep inside the bunker, Hank reached the control hub.

Rows of Cold War terminals fused with modern tactical overlays.

“Charming,” he muttered.

He bypassed encryption, rerouted power grids, and unlocked holding cells in lower wings.

On screen:

Twenty-three mutant minors.

Containment protocols are active.

“Working on it, children,” Hank said softly as his fingers flew across keys.

### Logan

Logan moved alone through reinforced corridors.

Guards fell quietly.

Efficient.

Measured.

No reckless charges.

Every strike deliberate.

He was not feral.

He was focused.

One corridor opened into a larger chamber—

And the smell hit him.

Metal.

Chemical residue.

Old pain.

Something in his bones stirred.

He didn’t understand it.

But he didn’t stop.

### The Holding Chamber

The final steel doors slid open with a hiss.

Logan stepped inside.

Two guards turned—

Too late.

Claws flashed.

Metal cut clean.

Bodies fell.

Silence.

Scott lifted his head slightly.

“Logan?”

Jean’s eyes widened faintly.

Storm allowed the smallest breath of relief.

Logan scanned the room once.

“Still breathing.”

Before he could move—

A low chuckle echoed from the upper catwalk.

Heavy boots stepped into view.

Sabretooth

Victor Creed.

Grinning.

“Well, I’ll be damned.”

From the opposite side, metallic coils uncoiled with a hiss.

Omega Red

Carbonadium tendrils scraping the concrete.

And emerging calmly from a reinforced door—

William Stryker

Measured. Unshaken.

Lady Deathstrike moved silently behind Logan.

He sensed her presence a fraction too late.

Metal claws clicked softly inches from his spine.

Stryker folded his hands.

“You came back.”

Logan didn’t look at him.

“I don’t know you.”

Stryker smiled faintly.

“That’s unfortunate.”

A slow step forward.

“You were something remarkable once.”

Jean strained against her restraints, trying to break the dampeners.

Stryker continued:

“They erased you. Twisted you. Left you feral.”

A beat.

“But you were ours first.”

Logan’s jaw tightened.

Stryker’s voice softened.

“You don’t even know what you are capable of.”

Sabretooth laughed.

“He doesn’t remember a thing.”

Stryker gestured slightly.

“Join us. We’ll make you strong again.”

Logan finally turned his head slightly.

His eyes moved to Scott.

To Jean.

To Storm.

Restrained.

Outnumbered.

He exhaled once.

“No.”

Claws extended slowly.

“I came to save my friends.”

He lowered into attack stance.

Stryker’s expression hardened.

“As you wish.”

He stepped back.

“Engage.”

Sabretooth dropped first.

Omega Red’s coils lashed outward.

Lady Deathstrike lunged from behind.

Three enhanced killers converging at once.

### The Clash

Sabretooth collided with Logan head-on.

The impact was thunderous. Claws locked. Foreheads slammed. The concrete beneath them fractured from the force.

Sabretooth grinned through blood.

“Miss me?”

Omega Red’s carbonadium coils snapped forward an instant later — one wrapping Logan’s right arm, another cinching tight around his ribs.

The pressure drove inward — cartilage tearing between unyielding metal ribs.

Logan grunted — breath punched out of him — but didn’t fall.

Lady Deathstrike moved with surgical calm.

Her organic claws flashed — not metal, but sharpened bone slicing clean through flesh. They carved across Logan’s shoulder and chest, deep and deliberate.

No sparks.

Just blood.

Logan staggered.

Omega tightened the coil.

The joint wrenched violently — tendons tearing as the adamantium bone refused to give.

Healing flared hot beneath his skin, but it wasn’t instant. Pain flooded him. His vision blurred at the edges.

Sabretooth capitalized — slamming Logan into the wall hard enough to crater it.

Three angles.

Three predators.

No wasted movement.

Deathstrike lunged again — this time her claws punched into Logan’s abdomen.

They sank deep.

He sucked in air sharply — not a scream. Just effort.

Then he leaned forward.

Driving himself deeper onto her claws.

Closing distance.

His good hand shot up — gripping her wrist — and he slammed her sideways into Omega’s coil housing.

The distraction loosened Omega’s grip just enough.

Logan twisted violently, snapping his own partially healed arm back into alignment with a sickening pop.

He headbutted Sabretooth — breaking Victor’s nose in a spray of blood.

Omega’s coil whipped around his throat.

Sabretooth tackled him low.

Deathstrike raked his back — long furrows tearing muscle open.

Logan dropped to one knee.

Bleeding heavily now.

Breathing harder.

Healing fighting to keep up.

Outnumbered

And this time — visibly straining.

But his eyes weren’t wild.

They were measuring.

Because this time—

He wasn’t fighting alone.

### Rogue’s Entry

The chamber doors exploded inward.

Rogue burst in.

She didn’t hesitate.

A guard barely had time to raise his rifle before she grabbed him by the collar, absorbing enough strength to fling him across the control console.

Restraint controls sparked.

She slammed his hand against the release switch.

Storm’s cuffs disengaged with a metallic snap.

Scott’s restraints dropped.

Jean’s dampeners flickered violently.

Omega tightened instinctively — but too late.

Storm moved first.

Wind pressure detonated outward, destabilizing Omega Red’s stance and forcing his coils to retract or risk being torn off balance.

Rogue grabbed a spare visor from a fallen guard and gave it to Scott.

Scott snapped the visor into place, and then a precise optic blast slammed into Sabretooth’s chest — driving him through a steel support beam.

Jean’s eyes ignited — controlled fury.

Telekinesis seized Deathstrike mid-lunge and hurled her across the chamber before she could carve into Logan again.

Logan glanced back.

Blood still dripping.

Chest rising hard.

The team was standing.

Not prisoners.

Teammates.

He spat blood onto the floor.

“’Bout time.”

The chamber erupted into coordinated combat.

For the first time—

They fought together.

### Hank’s Rescue

Deep below the main chamber—

Rows of containment cells slid open one by one.

Fluorescent lights flickered violently as **Beast** rerouted power from the dampening grid.

“Children,” Hank called gently, though the ground trembled beneath his feet, “please move quickly and calmly.”

Twenty-three frightened faces looked up at him.

Some levitating unintentionally.

Some glowing faintly.

Some trembling.

Hank crouched to eye level with the nearest child.

“You are safe now.”

Another tremor.

Concrete dust rained from the ceiling.

Above—

The battle raged.

### The Detonator

The chamber was already wrecked.

Concrete pulverized.

Steel beams twisted.

Blood streaked across the floor.

Logan stood hunched, ribs half-healed but still grinding when he moved. One sleeve torn away. Shoulder muscle knitting slowly under torn flesh.

Sabretooth circled again — slower now, but grinning.

Omega Red’s coils dragged across the broken floor, carbonadium scraping sparks from debris.

Lady Deathstrike moved carefully this time, organic claws slick with blood.

The X-Men were standing.

But no one was fresh.

Scott’s visor flared — a precise blast forcing Sabretooth backward into a collapsing pillar.

Storm’s wind pressure slammed Deathstrike into reinforced steel, pinning her for a breath.

Jean strained — her telekinesis tightening around Omega’s coils, bending them outward inch by inch.

For a moment—

The X-Men had momentum.

Logan stepped forward despite the pain, claws ready to finish it.

From the catwalk above, William Stryker watched with narrow eyes.

He didn’t shout.

He didn’t panic.

He simply reached into his coat.

Pressed the switch.

A low mechanical tone pulsed through the bunker.

Not loud.

But wrong.

Everyone felt it.

Then—

A deep explosion roared from below.

The entire facility shuddered.

### Collapse

The ground dipped under their feet.

Lights flickered violently.

Cracks spidered across concrete walls.

Support beams screamed.

Dust rained down.

Jean faltered first.

Her concentration broke for half a second.

That was all Omega Red needed.

His coil snapped forward — not controlled this time — violent and desperate.

It struck Jean across the torso mid-air.

Her telekinetic barrier shattered.

She hit the ground hard.

“Jean!” Scott shouted.

Something inside him snapped.

He removed the limiter instinctively.

A full-force optic blast detonated from his visor — uncontrolled, furious.

It slammed into Omega Red’s chest and carried him through a reinforced wall in a violent eruption of steel and debris.

The blast didn’t just push him.

It buried him.

Storm shifted instantly — abandoning precision for force.

A concentrated pressure burst tore through the corridor, driving Lady Deathstrike backward as collapsing beams rained down between them.

Sabretooth staggered upright through falling debris, coughing through smoke.

He looked at the crumbling ceiling.

Then at Logan.

Blood dripping from both of them.

“This place is done,” he growled.

Another tremor ripped through the chamber.

Chunks of ceiling collapsed between them.

Sabretooth gave Logan one last look.

“Next time.”

He disappeared into a side shaft as the structure caved inward.

Logan instinctively moved to pursue—

Ribs protesting.

Vision narrowing.

But Scott’s voice cut through the chaos.

“Logan! We need to get out!”

Logan froze.

He looked at Jean — unconscious in Storm’s arms.

He looked at Scott — visor smoking from overload.

He looked at the ceiling — seconds from collapse.

Then he made the choice.

He turned back.

“Move!” He barked.

This time—

Not as a weapon.

As part of the team.

### Extraction

Below, Hank ushered the last of the children toward the evacuation corridor.

“Up the stairwell! Follow the lights!”

Concrete dust choked the air.

Rogue sprinted past, carrying two younger kids under each arm, boots barely touching the ground.

“Move! Move!”

A tremor split the ceiling behind them.

Chunks of concrete crashed down, sealing the hallway they had just cleared.

Scott ran toward the hangar level, one hand braced against the wall to steady himself. His visor flickered faintly from heat stress.

Storm carried Jean carefully but steadily, wind cushioning falling debris away from her unconscious form.

Logan moved last.

Slower now.

Blood soaking through torn fabric. Cartilage still screaming with every breath. Shoulder still knitting under torn muscle.

A support beam above the corridor gave way with a scream of metal.

Three children froze beneath it.

Logan lunged forward.

He caught the beam with both hands.

The impact buckled his knees.

Metal shrieked.

Concrete fractured around him.

His claws punched into the steel instinctively, anchoring him.

The weight drove him down another inch.

Healing factor flared hot — not fast enough to prevent pain.

“Go!” he barked.

The children scrambled past him.

One stumbled.

He held the beam another second longer.

Longer than safe.

Then he shoved upward with everything he had left and dove forward—

The beam collapsed behind him in a thunderous crash, burying the corridor in debris.

He didn’t look back.

### The Hangar

The Blackbird’s silhouette stood at the far end of the underground hangar, engines spooling.

Scott vaulted into the cockpit, hands already moving across controls.

“Inside! Now!”

Storm guided the children up the ramp, wind shielding them from falling fragments.

Rogue secured the rear hatch, dragging the last crate of emergency supplies in before slamming it shut.

Hank sprinted across the hangar floor, leaping into the auxiliary jet just as the ceiling began to cave inward.

Logan reached the ramp last.

He staggered once — barely.

Rogue caught his arm automatically.

He pulled free, not harshly.

“I’m good.”

He wasn’t.

But he climbed aboard anyway.

As the ramp sealed, the hangar roof collapsed inward in sections.

Through the narrowing gap, Logan looked back.

Flames raced through fractured corridors.

A section of wall shifted in the distance.

For a brief second—

A carbonadium coil dragged itself from the rubble.

Then vanished into smoke.

He didn’t see Stryker.

He didn’t see Sabretooth.

But he knew.

They weren’t buried.

Not all of them.

Still—

The children were alive.

Jean was alive.

That was enough.

### Departure (Revised)

The Blackbird engines roared.

Scott lifted vertically through the collapsing shaft, debris scraping against the hull.

Below—

The bunker imploded in controlled sequence.

Secondary charges detonated in delayed chain reaction.

Fire tore upward through snow-covered rock.

Shockwaves rippled across the frozen landscape.

Scott’s breathing was steady.

Too steady.

In the cabin, Storm sat beside Jean, hand resting lightly over her shoulder as med scanners hummed.

Logan stood braced against the bulkhead.

Blood still dripping slowly from his side.

He watched the fire consume the place where something in his bones had stirred.

No triumph.

No rage.

Just closure.

### Second Extraction

Outside the blast radius, the auxiliary jet lifted off seconds later.

Hank piloted one-handed while sealing a gash along his forearm with a field wrap.

Rogue slumped into the co-pilot seat, adrenaline finally draining from her system.

Logan stood behind them.

Silent.

Watching the explosion fade into distant embers against the night sky.

He didn’t look victorious.

He looked… grounded.

### Aftermath (Revised)

Back at the mansion—

Emergency lights illuminated the courtyard.

Children were escorted inside, wrapped in blankets against the cold night air.

Some clung to each other.

Some stared at the mansion in disbelief.

One small boy paused near the steps.

He looked up at Logan.

At the torn suit.

At the blood still drying across his chest.

At the metal claws retracting slowly with a soft SNIKT.

The boy swallowed.

“…You held it,” he whispered.

Logan looked down at him.

“Yeah.”

The boy nodded once.

Then followed Hank inside.

No more words needed.

Federal authorities were already en route.

Canadian officials briefed.

Evidence transmitted.

Names cross-checked against missing persons reports.

Some of the older children had families waiting.

Some did not.

Charles met each of them personally.

Offering choice.

Reunification.

Protection.

Sanctuary.

No one forced.

Storm moved quickly toward the infirmary with Jean.

Med teams took over seamlessly.

Scott descended from the cockpit ramp, visor dimmed.

He paused.

His hand hovered near the visor controls for half a second longer than usual.

Then he stepped forward.

He met Logan’s eyes.

No speech.

Just a nod.

Earned.

Storm passed by, pausing briefly.

“You chose correctly.”

Logan nodded once.

Later—

In the infirmary wing—

Hank worked silently, scanning Logan’s torso with a portable diagnostic unit.

The monitor hummed softly as internal imaging projected across the screen.

“Remarkable,” Hank muttered under his breath.

He adjusted the display.

“Your skeletal structure remains intact, as expected. The adamantium frame absorbed the compression.”

He glanced at the bruising spreading across Logan’s side.

“However, the connective tissue between the ribs has suffered significant tearing. Intercostal cartilage separation. Pulmonary bruising. Severe muscular trauma.”

Logan stared at the ceiling.

“Feels like it.”

Hank gave him a sideways look.

“I imagine it would.”

He ran the scanner lower.

“And there’s residual carbonadium toxicity in your bloodstream. Omega Red’s coils emit a radioactive field. It appears to have temporarily suppressed your healing factor.”

Logan’s jaw tightened slightly.

“Yeah. Felt slower.”

“Yes,” Hank confirmed. “Your regeneration was functioning — but not at optimal efficiency.”

He powered down the device.

“The carbonadium traces are already breaking down. Once cleared, your natural healing rate should resume fully.”

Logan flexed his hand experimentally.

“Nothing permanent?”

Hank allowed himself a small smile.

“On you? Highly unlikely.”

He stepped back.

“You may consider refraining from catching collapsing infrastructure with your bare hands in the future.”

Logan exhaled through his nose.

“Noted.”

When it was done, Logan stepped out into the hallway.

He looked down at his hands.

Flexed them once.

Claws extended.

Retracted.

Tonight—

He didn’t hunt.

He didn’t chase.

He didn’t pursue revenge.

He protected.

And for the first time since waking in that forest—

He wasn’t thinking about leaving.

He was thinking about staying.

## Chapter Five — Morning Light

The mansion felt different in daylight.

Not quiet like the night before.

Not heavy like the bunker.

Alive.

Sunlight spilled across polished floors. Students moved through corridors with cautious excitement. News of the rescue had traveled quickly. Whispers softened when teachers passed.

Upstairs, outside the infirmary wing—

The door to Jean’s room opened gently.

**Storm** stepped out first, composed as always.

Behind her, **Wolverine** followed, hands in the pockets of his jacket again—back in civilian clothes, recovered from the fight overnight thanks to Hank’s help.

They closed the door quietly.

Footsteps approached from the corridor.

**Cyclops** walked toward them, holding a small arrangement of fresh white lilies.

Logan’s brow lifted.

“Well,” he said lightly, “where are you going, Cyclops?”

Scott adjusted his grip on the flowers.

“Just checking on Jean.”

Storm’s eyes flicked briefly to the bouquet.

“Then say what you came to say,” she said gently. “Before it’s too late.”

Scott hesitated — and then a small, reluctant smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

He couldn’t quite hide it.

Logan caught it immediately.

“Guy fights enhanced mercenaries,” Logan added, smirking, “but can’t win a conversation.”

Scott gave him a look — not annoyed this time. Amused.

They shared something unspoken there, less edge now.

Storm inclined her head toward the door.

“We’ll leave you to it.”

She and Logan walked down the corridor together.

Scott exhaled once.

Then knocked.

Inside the Room

Jean looked up from the book resting against her knees.

Sunlight framed her in soft gold.

She smiled when she saw him.

“Come in.”

Scott stepped inside, closing the door behind him.

He placed the flowers carefully into a vase on the bedside table. His movements were deliberate, controlled, like everything else he did.

He sat beside her.

“How are you?”

“Better,” she said. “Hank says I overextended.”

Scott nodded.

She studied him.

“You look different.”

He gave a small, nervous grin.

“Do I?”

“Yes.”

She closed the book.

“Is there something you want to say?”

Scott inhaled slowly.

“There is.”

He folded his hands together; eyes lowered for a moment, not out of weakness, but searching for precision.

“There’s something I’ve felt for a while.”

A beat.

“I’m not always good at…” He gestured vaguely. “This.”

Jean waited patiently.

Scott’s jaw tightened slightly.

“But when you were hurt last night, I knew one thing,”

His voice changed.

Less measured.

More honest.

“I was afraid to lose you.”

Silence filled the room.

Jean’s expression softened, not surprised.

Recognition.

Scott looked down as soon as the words left him, as if saying them aloud made them heavier.

His voice hardened slightly, reflexively.

“I trust the team. I trust you. But that doesn’t mean I wasn’t terrified.”

Jean shifted closer.

She reached for his hand.

He looked at their hands first.

Then at her.

“I know how you feel,” she said gently. “You carry everything alone.”

A small pause.

“You don’t have to.”

Scott met her eyes fully now.

“We can talk more,” she continued. A faint warmth in her voice, “Maybe outside. In the garden. Like the old training days.”

Scott’s face brightened, not dramatically, just enough.

He nodded once.

“I’d like that.”

Jean smiles after hearing it.

Far enough from the door to pretend they weren’t listening.

Close enough to hear everything.

Logan leaned against the wall, arms crossed, pretending to study a framed landscape painting.

Beside him, **Storm** stood with perfect composure.

From inside Jean’s room, muffled voices drifted through the quiet hallway.

A pause.

Then Scott’s voice, steady, but softer than usual.

Logan tilted his head slightly.

“C’mon,” he muttered under his breath.

Another pause.

Then silence.

Logan squinted at the door like it had personally offended him.

“Just tell her you love her, you damn wuss.”

Storm’s shoulders trembled ever so slightly.

She pressed her lips together, fighting composure.

Logan glanced sideways at her.

“You’re enjoying this.”

“I would never,” she said smoothly.

Inside, faint laughter filtered through the door.

Logan shook his head.

“Guy can strategize a battlefield but can’t say three words.”

Storm let out the smallest breath of a laugh.

And then—

A calm, measured voice drifted from behind them.

“You know,” said **Professor X**, “it is considered impolite to invade someone’s privacy.”

Both of them jolted.

Logan straightened instantly.

Storm turned, perfectly composed again.

“Oh,” Logan muttered. “It’s just you.”

Charles regarded them with mild amusement.

“Good morning.”

“Morning, Professor,” Storm replied.

“We weren’t doing anything,” Logan added quickly.

Charles raised an eyebrow.

“Of course you weren’t.”

A small beat.

“Don’t you have classes to teach, Ororo?”

“Yes, Professor.”

“And you,” Charles continued, looking at Logan, “have training to attend.”

Logan grunted softly.

“Yeah.”

They began walking down the corridor.

Storm regained her composure entirely.

Logan muttered under his breath one last time.

“Still could’ve said it better.”

Storm finally allowed herself a quiet laugh.

Behind them, Charles remained where he was.

He turned slightly, gaze resting toward Jean’s closed door.

He didn’t need telepathy to sense the shift.

Two young souls, burdened too early, had finally stopped standing alone.

A faint, satisfied smile touched his face.

Then he turned his chair and rolled away down the sunlit corridor.

The mansion felt lighter.

And for once—

So did everyone inside it.

### Later that night

A roadside bar outside town.

Neon sign flickering in the cold.

Inside, low country music hums under muted conversation.

Logan sits alone at the far end of the counter.

Brown jacket back on. Suit gone.

A glass of whiskey in front of him.

An unlit cigar resting between his fingers.

The bartender glances at him cautiously.

“You passing through?”

Logan shrugs.

“Something like that.”

He lights the cigar.

Smoke curls upward.

For a moment, he looks exactly like the man he was in the forest—

Alone. Detached.

But not hunted.

Two local men notice him from across the bar.

They exchange a glance.

Walk over.

“You’re not from around here,” one says.

Logan doesn’t turn.

“No.”

“Looks like you’re drinking alone.”

Logan exhales smoke slowly.

“Doesn’t bother me.”

One of them steps closer.

“Mind if we—”

Before Logan can even turn—

A calm voice speaks from behind them.

“Is there a problem, gentlemen?”

The men turn.

Standing there:

**Scott**, jacket zipped, posture relaxed.

Beside him, **Jean Grey**.

**Storm**, composed as ever.

And a slightly amused **Rogue** leaning casually near the doorway.

The two men hesitate.

Take in the group.

Something about their presence shifts the air.

“No problem,” one mutters quickly.

They step away.

Return to their table.

Scott walks over and pulls out a stool beside Logan.

Jean takes the other side.

Storm and Rogue sit nearby.

Logan doesn’t look at them immediately.

He takes a slow sip of his drink.

“You know,” he says finally, “I could’ve handled it.”

Scott nods.

“I know.”

A beat.

“That’s why we came.”

Logan glances sideways.

Scott continues:

“So you don’t have to.”

Silence settles.

Comfortable.

Jean signals the bartender.

“Five.”

Storm adds gently, “Something warm.”

Rogue grins. “Make mine strong.”

The bartender hesitates for only a moment before lining up glasses.

They clink lightly.

No speeches.

No dramatic declarations.

Just shared space.

Shared air.

Shared choice.

Logan looks around the table.

For once, he isn’t sitting near the exit.

He isn’t scanning the room.

He leans back slightly in his chair.

Smoke drifting upward.

Scott says something dry about early morning training.

Rogue rolls her eyes.

Storm hides a smile.

Jean watches quietly.

Logan mutters:

“Guess I’m not leaving at six.”

Scott smirks.

“You better.”

Logan shakes his head faintly.

A half-smile, barely there.

The neon light flickers outside.

The music plays on.

And for the first time since waking in that forest—

Logan isn’t alone in a bar.

He’s surrounded.

Fade out.
