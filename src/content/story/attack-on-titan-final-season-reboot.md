## PRELUDE

Long before walls were raised, before crowns were forged from fear, there was a system, where Founding Titan was one above all, and the other Titans were their loyal kings guard, who had their own empire, unique statuses, and in time re-unite upon the call of the Founding Titan.

The **Attack Titan** was one of them, loyal to the king, and fought alongside other shifters. He was treated as a brawn with no special features unlike Armor, Jaws, etc.

It also made him adaptive to different situations in ways other Titan shifters couldn't.

But something changed during the Great Titan War; it was discovered that this Titan alone could operate beyond the system that bound all others. Commands issued through the Founding Titan faltered when they reached it. Not because the Attack Titan was immune, but because it did not yield. The will of the Founder found no place to take hold.

Why this occurred was never understood.

Some believed the Attack Titan carried a flaw.  
Others called it a curse.  
The royal family chose a simpler explanation:

It was unreliable.

And so, it was cast aside.

Yet after the war, the Attack Titan endured, passed down quietly, always appearing at moments of collapse, always in the hands of those who questioned the world they were born into. It did not change history by force. It resisted it by existing.

That resistance accumulated.

Unseen. Unrecorded. Unfinished.

Until it reached one final inheritor.

Eren Yeager.

## CHAPTER 1: MARLEY

### Four years after the Battle of Shiganshina

At Marley's central railway station, families crowd the platforms long before the train arrives.

The air smells of coal smoke and oil, of metal warmed by bodies pressed too close together. Vendors shout over one another, selling flags and rationed sweets wrapped in thin paper. Children sit on their parents' shoulders, craning their necks toward the tracks, faces painted with red and gold stripes.

Victory is expected.

The war against the Middle East Allied Forces is over, and victory, Marley is told, always comes home.

A whistle shrieks.

The sound cuts through the station like a blade.

As the train screeches to a halt, steam erupts around the platform, and the waiting crowd explodes into cheers. Flags are raised. Applause rolls outward in waves as compartment doors slide open, and soldiers begin to step down.

Uniforms are dusty. Faces hollowed. Some men limp. Some avoid looking at the crowd entirely.

It doesn't matter.

They are welcomed as heroes all the same.

Among them stands the Warrior Unit.

Reiner Braun steps onto the platform first, his boots hitting stone with a dull thud. He is flanked by Zeke Yeager, Porco Galliard (Jaw Titan), and Pieck Finger (Cart Titan); figures already familiar to Marley, already half-mythologized. Behind them come the next generation: Colt Grice, posture stiff with pride as the chosen successor to the Beast Titan, and Falco Grice and Gabi Braun, selected as candidates for the Armored Titan.

Cameras flash.

Someone shouts Reiner's name.

Another calls him _Marley's shield_.

He does not respond.

Zeke's reunion is brief. His grandparents push through the crowd with quiet urgency; their faces drawn and cautious even in relief. There is no cheering, no waving, just a short embrace and quick steps away from the platform.

They disappear into the city without a ceremony.

Reiner watches them go.

Then the noise fades back in.

His gaze drifts, not to the flags or the applause, but to a group gathered near the edge of the platform. Civilians. Marleyans. Laughing.

They point at a cluster of Eldian soldiers further down the line, men who survived the war without being transformed. Men spared, not honored.

"Guess they weren't worth the serum," someone sneers.

"Cowards," another laughs. "At least Titans die useful."

The laughter is easy. Casual. Thoughtless.

Reiner feels his jaw tighten.

He says nothing.

He can do nothing.

He stands there, unmoving, the noise of celebration pressing in around him as the weight of sins no one else remembers settles deeper into his chest.

His mother's voice cuts through the crowd.

"Reiner."

He turns, looking at his mother.

Mother: "Let's go home."

She stands a few steps away, hands clasped tightly in front of her, eyes shining with pride and something more fragile beneath it. Gabi stands beside her, close enough that her shoulder brushes his arm.

Reiner forces himself to move.

He steps away from the platform, away from the cheers, away from the soldiers still disembarking, and follows them into the flow of the city. Behind him, the station continues to celebrate, unaware, and uninterested, in the cost of the victory it claims.

### Reiner's Home

That night, sleep refuses to come.

Reiner lies on his back, staring at the cracked ceiling of the small apartment. The walls are thin. He can hear footsteps from the neighbors above, the distant sound of a radio playing a patriotic march somewhere down the block, the faint hum of the city settling into rest.

This is Marley at night.

Safe.

Orderly.

Unforgiving.

His room is sparse, neatly made bed, a single wooden chair; a folded uniform placed carefully at the foot of the mattress. On the wall hangs a faded poster celebrating the Warrior Unit: heroic silhouettes of Titans towering over kneeling enemies, Marleyan soldiers standing proudly behind them.

Reiner turns his head away from it.

When he closes his eyes, the ceiling becomes a stone.

Walls rise around him, three of them.

He hears the scream again.

"Reiner!"

The ground shakes. The sky burns red. He feels the weight of armor settle over his body, heavy and useless, crushing instead of protecting. Faces blur together, fear, trust, betrayal, all screaming his name.

A soldier.

A warrior.

A hero.

A lie.

Memories spill in without order.

Being told, again and again, that Eldians exist to atone. That honor is earned only through sacrifice. That becoming a Warrior is the only way to be seen as human in Marley's eyes.

Standing in line as a child, shoulders tense, listening to instructors speak of duty and sin in the same breath.

Porco's laughter when he failed. The sharp words. The smirks.

His father's face, distant, disappointed. A Marleyan man who wanted nothing to do with an Eldian son, even one chosen as a Warrior.

Then Marcel.

The truth whispered too late.

_You weren't supposed to be chosen._

The memory fractures.

Teeth.

Blood.

A scream cut short.

Shiganshina.

Breaking the wall in a rage he did not fully understand, convincing himself that monsters lived behind it, only to find children, families, people just like him.

Sharing meals. Laughing. Training.

Eren.

Someone who trusted him.

Someone he betrayed every single day.

Reiner's jaw tightens. His hands curl into fists against the sheets.

This is what it means to come home.

By the time morning fully comes, he does not feel rested.

Only older.

In the morning, Marley wakes as it always does.

Reiner sits at the small kitchen table as his mother prepares breakfast. The radio hums softly, broadcasting news of the victory overseas, voices praising Marley's strength and the bravery of its Warriors.

Outside the window, the city moves on. Children in school uniforms hurry down the street. Workers head toward factories. Marleyan flags hang from buildings, bright and clean.

Normal.

His mother speaks about rations, about neighbors, about how proud she is. Her voice trembles just slightly when she says it.

Reiner nods. Smiles when expected.

He steps outside later, walking streets he has known his entire life.

People glance at him with respect. Some whisper. Some nod approvingly.

A hero has returned.

No one asks where he has been.

No one asks what he has done.

No one wants to know.

As Reiner walks toward the military district, boots echoing against stone, a single thought settles heavy in his chest:

_This world only works if people like me keep lying._

### Marley Military Office

Marley didn't celebrate for long.

Victory is a luxury reserved for civilians.

Inside the military district, the streets are quieter, cleaner. Uniformed guards stand at measured intervals; rifles polished, expressions neutral. Every building bears the same architecture: stone facades, iron gates, banners of red and gold reminding all who pass of Marley's dominance and sacrifice.

Reiner walks these halls with the others, boots echoing against marble floors he knows he does not belong to.

This is not a place for Eldians.

It never has been.

They are escorted into a secure chamber deep within the military complex, a room designed less for comfort than authority. The ceiling is high, supported by stone columns carved with reliefs of Marley's "great victories." Titans loom in the artwork, crushing enemies beneath their feet, while Marleyan soldiers stand untouched behind them.

Heroes in the background.

Weapons in the foreground.

Commander Magath stands near the central table; hands clasped behind his back. His expression is unreadable, not proud, not angry. Only tired.

Across from him sit high-ranking officers, men who have never set foot on a battlefield, yet have decided the fate of nations with ink and maps.

And at the head of the chamber,

Willy Tybur.

He is dressed plainly, almost modestly. No uniform. No insignia. Yet the room bends around him. Conversations soften when he shifts. Officers straighten unconsciously.

The Tybur family does not command Marley by law.

They command it by myth.

For generations, the Tyburs have stood apart, Eldians elevated above other Eldians, custodians of the War Hammer Titan, keepers of the story that Marley tells the world.

The story where Marley is the victim.

The story where Titans are necessary.

The story where Eldians are both curse and salvation.

Reiner takes his seat among the Warriors.

He feels small.

Magath begins the briefing.

"The Middle East Allied Forces adapted faster than projected," he says. "Their Anti-Titan artillery neutralized two Pure Titan divisions within minutes. Their weapons pierced armor we once believed impenetrable. Airship coordination destabilized transformation zones. Our superiority was challenged, and in several engagements, surpassed."

He pauses.

"Which brings us to the real outcome of this war."

Maps are unfurled. Not just battlefields, but **research facilities, weapons foundries, captured laboratories**.

"The campaign's primary objective was never territorial," Magath continues. "It was technological."

The officers lean forward.

"The Middle East had surpassed us in Anti-Titan warfare. If Marley intended to face the Founding Titan, or the Rumbling, we could not do so with faith in Titans alone."

The implication settles heavily.

Titans are no longer enough.

"We seized their research," Magath says. "Their artillery designs. Their firing mechanisms. Their penetration formulas. Their failure reports. Everything they learned by killing our Titans."

A murmur ripples through the room.

Not fear.

Calculation.

"The age of Titans is ending," Magath says flatly.

No one denies it.

Titans were never sacred to Marley. They were weapons. And weapons that can be countered must either evolve, or be supported by something stronger.

That weakness cannot be allowed to linger.

Another map is placed atop the others.

Shipping routes. Airspace corridors. Military installations.

And at the center of it all,

A single island circled in red.

Paradis.

The Founding Titan.

The island devil.

The ultimate variable.

Willy Tybur finally speaks.

"The world does not fear Marley," he says calmly. "It fears the Founding Titan."

Silence.

"That fear," Willy continues, "is the only thing keeping this nation relevant. Especially now, when Titans alone can no longer guarantee dominance."

His gaze drifts-briefly-to Reiner and other warriors.

"And especially after a warning from none other than Eren Yeager."

The name lands heavily.

Reiner's stomach tightens.

So they know.

"So long as the Founding Titan exists," Willy says, "Marley can present itself as the shield. The necessary evil. The nation that bears the sin so the rest of the world may sleep."

A faint smile.

"But a shield must face the blade."

The plan unfolds, not as a military strategy, but as a **carefully crafted narrative**.

Paradis will be attacked but not hastily. Not blindly. Marley has waited because it had to. It needed time to adapt, to re-arm, to ensure that when the Founding Titan finally revealed itself… Marley would not be helpless.

The world must see Marley bleed.

Must see its Warriors struggle.

Must see the island devils emerge as the greatest threat mankind has ever faced.

Only then will the world unite.

Only then will Marley remain indispensable.

"The Warriors will breach the walls first," Magath adds. "Once engagement begins, the War Hammer Titan will enter the field. Anti-Titan artillery and armored divisions, refined using Middle Eastern designs will be positioned outside the walls under Zeke Yeager's command."

Reiner hears it clearly now.

This is not a mission.

It is a calculated sacrifice, backed by technology, myth, and fear.

The truth, that Marley ruled the world through Titans for generations will be buried beneath a louder story.

A necessary lie.

Reiner sits among the Warriors as the briefing ends.

The familiar weight settles into his chest.

They didn't wait because they were afraid.

They waited because they wanted to be ready.

_We're going back._

No one asks if he is ready.

No one ever does.

### **Paradis Island (after 8 months)**

The airships cross the ocean under cover of thick clouds, engines humming low and steady; a constant vibration felt through metal floors and tightened harnesses. The ships are also coming filled with tanks and soldiers, led by Zeke.

Inside the airship, warriors stand ready, secured in their gear, hands resting near triggers and swords out of habit rather than need. Below them, the sea stretches endlessly dark, indifferent, swallowing the distance between continents as if it had never existed at all.

Reiner stares through the open hatch, watching the clouds thin.

For a moment, there is only water.

Then,

Land.

A jagged coastline cuts through the mist, sharper than he remembers. Darker. He feels his chest tightened as the island grows clearer beneath them.

Paradis.

Porco leans forward slightly, squinting. Pieck's expression shifts, alert, calculating.

Something is wrong.

The island looks… different.

As the airship descends, the truth becomes unmistakable.

There are no three walls.

Only one.

A massive outer structure dominates the landscape, thick, angular, deliberately ugly. Crystallized armored plating lines its surface; artillery emplacements embedded at regular intervals. Spotlights sweep the terrain below in slow, overlapping arcs. This is not a wall meant to hide behind.

It is a wall built to fight. Island Soldiers running, taking their formations near the wall, entering a lift inside built by Armin and Hange.

Beyond it, set further inland, stands another barrier. Smaller. Tighter. Completely sealed from above, its surface is smooth and uninterrupted. No towers. No gaps.

A fortress within a fortress.

A sanctuary.

Reiner feels his breath catch in his throat.

This isn't fear.

It's a recognition.

_They were preparing._

Not for the Titans.

For war.

The airship slows further, drifting into position as soldiers peer down in uneasy silence. This isn't the island they were told about. This isn't a land of frightened people hiding behind a stone.

This is a city built to endure annihilation.

Then Reiner sees movement atop the inner wall.

Figures in dark cloaks stand against the sky, unmoving, deliberate. Not scrambling. Not panicking.

Waiting.

Soldiers.

At their center stands a man with long hair caught in the wind, posture relaxed, gaze lifted, not toward the airships, but toward the horizon beyond them.

Reiner knows that silhouette instantly.

His heart drops.

In front of him, aligned with quiet precision, stands the Levi Squad, still, focused, ready.

And then the man steps forward.

Eren Yeager.

He doesn't shout.

He doesn't transform.

He simply stands there, looking up at them.

Waiting.

For the first time since the meeting in Marley's war room, Reiner understands something with absolute clarity:

They aren't attacking an unprepared enemy.

They are walking into a trap.

---

## CHAPTER 2: EVOLUTION OF PARADISE PART 1

### Quarters of Military inside Wall Sina (few months after sea expedition, year after the Battle in Shiganshina)

The night breaks first.

Not with sound, but with breath.

Eren bolts upright in his bed, lungs burning as if he has surfaced from deep water. Sweat clings to his skin. His hands tremble, fingers digging into the sheets as memories crash over one another, faces, screams, blood, walls falling, chains tightening.

_Run._

_Fight._

_You're free._

He presses his palms to his eyes, but it doesn't help. The images are not _seen_. They are _remembered_.

A knock comes fast, too fast.

"Eren!"

Mikasa doesn't wait for an answer. The door opens, light spilling into the room. Armin follows close behind, eyes wide with worry.

Eren tries to speak. Nothing comes out.

His chest tightens again and this time he doesn't fight it.

He breaks.

His breath stutters, shoulders shaking as he bends forward, fingers digging into his hair like he's trying to tear something _out_ of himself. Mikasa is at his side immediately, steady hands grounding him. Armin kneels in front of him, searching for his face.

"It's okay," Armin says softly. "You're here. You're not alone."

Eren laughs weakly at that.

Not alone.

### After 5 mins

They gather without a ceremony.

No summons. No formal orders.

Just people who know something is wrong.

Levi leans against the wall, arms crossed, eyes sharp. Hange stands nearby, unusually quiet. Jean and Connie sit on the floor, back against the wall. Sasha clutches a mug she never drinks from. Historia sits close, close enough to reach Eren if he needs it.

Mikasa never let's go of him.

For a long moment, no one speaks.

Then Armin does.

"Do you remember what you said at the sea?"

Eren looks up.

"You said… that maybe freedom wasn't on the other side of the ocean. That maybe it was just another enemy."

Armin swallows. "You said it like you knew something, not just the facts, but something that has been haunting you since we learned the truth. You haven't been the same since then."

Silence settles again, but this time, it waits.

Eren exhales slowly.

"I didn't want you to know," he says. His voice is hoarse. "Because once you do… you can't unsee it."

Levi clicks his tongue. "Too late for that."

Eren lets out a weak breath that almost resembles a smile.

Then he starts talking.

Not standing. Not commanding.

Just… sitting on the floor, back against the bed, surrounded by people who have bled beside him.

He tells them he learned about his father, not just the facts he already shared, but the things he chose to keep it to himself.

He tells about Grisha's life in Marley. About the internment zone. The armbands. The lies taught as truth. About his sister. About the moment everything broke.

He tells them about the Titans Marley used as weapons. About children trained to die for a nation that would never accept them, Reiner, Annie, Bertolt, Zeke and many other kids following the delusion fed by their authority.

Jean's jaw tightens.

"So all this time…" he mutters. "We were fighting people just like us."

Eren nods.

Then comes the hardest part.

He tells them how Grisha got the Attack Titan. How the Founding Titan was stolen. How the power passed to him.

And finally,

"The Smiling Titan," Eren says quietly.

Mikasa stiffens.

Historia's breath catches.

"That Titan," Eren continues, eyes fixed on the floor. "The one that killed my mother… she was a woman named Dina Fritz. She was of royal blood, my father's first wife. She was turned into Titan and sent to Paradis as punishment."

No one speaks.

"My father didn't know she killed my mom," Eren adds.

His fists clench.

"And the day I touched her… that was the first time I used the Founding Titan. Not because I understood it. Because she had royal blood."

Hange exhales slowly, eyes wide with realization.

"So that's the key," she whispers.

Eren nods. "Royal blood. That's how the Founder responds."

Levi straightens.

"And you planned to carry all this alone?" He asks flatly.

Eren doesn't answer.

Levi steps forward.

"You don't get to decide that" he says sharply. "You don't get to play martyr just because the world's ugly."

Jean snorts. "I _told_ you," He adds, glaring. "Stop acting like a damn hero. You're terrible at it."

Connie chuckles weakly. "Yeah. Heroes don't look like they're about to pass out every five minutes."

Sasha finally takes a sip from her mug. "Also," she says, "if you died without telling us any of this, I would've haunted you."

That earns a small, shaky laugh.

Mikasa tightens her grip on Eren's sleeve. "You don't have to protect us from the truth," she says. "We chose this too."

Armin nods. "And if the world is bigger… then we face it together."

Eren feels it then.

Not the weight.

The release.

The burden doesn't vanish, but it _moves_. It spreads. It becomes something shared.

Historia shifts forward.

"If royal blood is the key," she says quietly, "then I'll help."

Everyone turns.

"I won't be a symbol," she continues. "And I won't be used. But if my blood can help you use this power, help us survive, then I'll choose that."

Eren looks at her, stunned.

"You don't have to do that," he says.

Historia meets his gaze without hesitation.

"I'm choosing this," she replies. "Just like you did."

For the first time in a long while,

Eren doesn't feel scared.

---

## CHAPTER 3: EVOLUTION OF PARADISE PART 2

### Next Day at training arena

The ground is silent.

Eren and Historia stand at the center of the practice arena; their figures small against the vast, open space. Everyone else keeps their distance; Levi Squad, Hange, the soldiers, all positioned carefully along the perimeter.

No one knows what will happen.

Everyone knows something will.

Hange raises a hand.

"At my signal," she says, voice steady but tense. "If anything goes wrong, anything, you pull back immediately."

Eren nods.

Historia takes a breath, then extends her hand.

Eren hesitates only for a moment before taking it.

The instant their skin touches, light flashes.

Not blinding, _piercing_.

The world collapses inward.

### Ethereal Plane

They stand somewhere else.

They are standing on a vast desert, pale and endless, illuminated by starlight. The air feels heavy, ancient, as if it remembers everything that has ever happened.

Before them rises a massive tree made of light.

Its trunk glows softly, its branches stretching outward into infinity, each one vanishing into darkness.

They move forward instinctively.

As they almost approach it, they see her.

A small girl steps out from the light of the tree, barefoot; her expression is cautious but curious. Her eyes hold no malice, only exhaustion far too old for a child.

"Who are you?" Historia asks gently.

The girl doesn't answer.

Historia frowns slightly.

Something feels wrong, but she feels something familiar about her.

Historia and Eren extend their hands together.  
The girl steps forward and places her small hands into theirs.

For a single heartbeat,

Eren feels a **pull**.

Not forward.

Not backward.

_Everywhere._

Faces brush against his mind; men and women he does not know, eyes filled with resolve, fear, defiance. Their presence is fleeting, overlapping, gone before he can grasp them.

_Who…?_

Then it's gone.

The sensation snaps away as if it never existed.

The world shatters.

Fire erupts across the desert.

Screams tear through the air.

A village burns.

Ymir's memory begins.

They see a village burning.

A young girl is dragged through the mud as soldiers laugh. A king stands above her, cold, satisfied. Her people are slaughtered. She is branded as a slave.

She lets a pig loose which was hunted by the soldiers for food.

People bail on her.

The punishment is cruel.

She is hunted like an animal.

An arrow pierces her side. Dogs tear at her heels. Bleeding, terrified, she flees into the forest and collapses into the hollow of a massive tree.

She falls.

Into a pond.

Into darkness.

Something moves.

She is almost passing out.

A creature, parasitic, spine-like, binds itself to her spine.

Power floods her veins.

She rises whole.

Unbroken.

Destroying everything around her vicinity, the first titan was born.

She returns.

Not to freedom, but to her master.

The king uses her.

He exploits her innocence. Her devotion. Her fear.

Empires rise beneath her feet. Nations burn. Millions die. To the world, she becomes a devil.

She bears the king's children.

Maria.

Rose.

Sina.

Thirteen years have passed since the fateful incident.

Her body has weakened.

When an enemy strikes, she steps forward without hesitation.

The arrow meant for the king pierces her heart.

She falls.

This time, she does not heal.

The king orders her to stand.

She does not.

Her body is torn apart. Her bone marrow is fed to her daughters, while the remains are fed to the subjects. Her power divided in desperation.

In the realm beyond life, she awakens.

Light spreads outward, branches connecting her children, then their children, then countless others.

Subjects of Ymir.

Nine powers.

Endless obedience.

She builds Titans from sand, again and again, across generations, following commands she was never taught to question.

The vision fades.

Eren and Historia stand trembling.

Historia collapses to her knees.

Tears stream down her face as she crawls toward the girl and pulls the girl into her embrace.

"I'm sorry," Historia sobs. "I'm so sorry you had to go through all of this."

The girl stiffens, then relaxes.

Historia notices something then.

The girl's mouth.

Her tongue is gone.

Without hesitation, Historia scoops sand from the ground, shaping it carefully, gently. She forms a tongue and places it where it belongs.

The girl gasps.

Then,

She speaks.

Her eyes widen in wonder.

"Thank you," she whispers.

She turns to Eren.

Eren cannot move.

His chest feels hollow.

"I know you," the girl says softly. "I know everything you've been through. I learned it from your parents."

Eren's breath catches.

"My… parents?"

She nods. "When we die, our souls return to this tree. Everything becomes one. Kings from the past called it the co-ordinates."

She bows her head.

"I'm sorry," she says. "For everything that happened because of my weakness."

Eren steps forward.

"You were used," he says. "By our ancestors. And we're still paying for their sins."

His fists clench.

"I'll end this," he says. "I swear it."

He kneels before her and takes her hands.

"Please," he pleads. "Lend me your power one last time. I promise, no one will ever use you again."

The girl begins to cry after hearing his plea.

No one has ever asked her before.

Historia places a hand on her shoulder.

"You don't have to," she says gently. "We won't force you."

The girl looks up.

"If I help you," she asks, "will I be free from this torment?"

Eren meets her gaze.

"Yes," he says. "I'll end this war. I'll make sure no one controls you again."

She nods.

"Remember," she says, "you only need the royal blood to come here. After that… my power is yours."

She reaches out.

Eren takes her hand.

Time stops.

Power surges. Their bodies illuminate.

In the real world, the arena explodes with light as energy erupts outward. Stone cracks. The air trembles. A Titan form begins to assemble around Eren, vast and overwhelming.

The ground shakes.

Walls crumble. People around the walls and the Garrison regiments are in panic. Commander Pyxis watches it unfold.

The Colossal Titans within are revealed, silent, unmoving.

Everyone watches in awe.

Fear.

Wonder.

Witnessing the power that once belonged to kings.

Across the sea, Eldians in Marley feel it.

Reiner drops to his knees, breath stolen from his lungs.

A voice echoes across the world.

**"Leave us alone."**

Eren's voice.

**"We do not want war. But if you come for us…"**

The air grows heavy.

**"…you will face the consequences of your choices."**

Reiner's thoughts shake.

_"Eren… what have you done?"_

---

## CHAPTER 4: EVOLUTION OF PARADISE PART 3

The Titan does not remain.

Cracks race across its massive form, light bleeding through the fractures as the body begins to dissolve. Steam and smoke swallow the arena; the ground trembling until-finally, it stops.

Silence follows.

Then movement.

Figures rush forward as the smoke thins. At the center of the impact zone, two shapes emerge.

Eren and Historia.

Levi reaches them first, gripping Eren and Historia's arm and pulling him clear of the settling debris. Historia stumbles slightly but stays on her feet, breathing hard. Both of them cough, drawing in air as if returning from somewhere far deeper than the ground beneath them.

Everyone waits.

Eren straightens slowly. His hands tremble, then clench into fists.

He looks up.

A smile breaks across his face.

"We did it," he says. "We have the upper hand in this war."

Relief spreads instantly.

Mikasa exhales sharply, tension leaving her shoulders. Armin closes his eyes for a moment; a hand pressed to his chest. Hange lets out a shout of pure exhilaration. Connie and Sasha jump, laughing, disbelief giving way to excitement. Jean smiles.

For the first time since the warning,

Hope feels real.

### Assemble Hall, evening

Later, inside the assembly hall, the mood shifts from celebration to focus.

Eren and Historia explain everything.

The Ethereal Plane.

Ymir.

The truth behind the Founding Titan and how its power can be accessed, understood, and restrained.

They also report what followed the collapse of the walls.

Annie Leonhart, freed when the structures fell has been secured.

The room grows quiet as the implications settle.

Armin speaks first.

"The walls collapsing doesn't have to be a loss," he says, already sketching ideas in his mind. "We can restructure them. Use the terrain to our advantage. We make sure civilians are protected and we control how the enemy moves."

Hange's eyes light up immediately.

"I'll work with you," she says. "We can redesign everything, fortifications, evacuation routes, kill zones. This changes how wars are fought here."

Eren nods. "I'll spend more time in the Plane with Historia," he adds. "I need to understand the Founder better. Properly. Good thing is the time works differently there, we can spend forever there, but on the outside world it will be just a moment."

Historia steps forward. "From what we know, I don't need to be with him every time," she says calmly. "Only to help him reach Ymir. After that… they can manage on their own."

Levi crosses his arms.

"Good," he says. "Then we start tomorrow."

No speeches.

No hesitation.

Paradis has work to do.

## PREPARATION OF WAR

### The Ethereal Plane

The sand is cool beneath Eren's fingers.

He sits cross-legged beneath the tree of light, sculpting shapes without urgency, letting them to collapse, reshaping them again. Not Titans. Not yet. Just forms. Frames. Possibilities.

Ymir watches from nearby, feet buried in the sand, head tilted with quiet curiosity.

"This one looks strange," she says, pointing to a half-formed structure.

Eren snorts softly. "Yeah. I'm not good at subtle."

Historia laughs; the sounds small but bright in the vast stillness. She sits beside Ymir, showing her how to shape the sand into simple things, a cup, a bird, a crooked little house.

Ymir smiles every time it works.

No one is commanding her.

They talk about nothing important.

About how stars look different here.

About how sand remembers hands.

About how Historia used to hate being called special.

Eren feels the power humming in him, vast, endless, but he doesn't reach for it.

Not fully.

Not yet.

"I'm trying not to take more than I need," he admits quietly.

Ymir nods. "That's new."

Behind him, the sand shifts on its own.

A massive silhouette begins to form, ribs arcing outward; a tall skeletal outline, incomplete. Not a Titan. Not a weapon.

Something is waiting for me.

Eren turns, unsettled. "That's… not what I meant to make."

Ymir studies it for a long time.

"It's what you haven't decided yet."

Eren exhales slowly and lets the sand fall through his fingers.

### Inside the Walls - Engineering Room

Paper covers every surface.

Armin hasn't noticed the time in hours.

"If we angle the outer fortifications like this," he murmurs, tracing lines with charcoal, "we force their advance into narrow zones. Airships lose maneuverability. Titans can't swarm."

Hange leans over his shoulder, eyes gleaming, not with madness, but focus.

"And if we integrate vertical artillery here-oh. Oh, that's beautiful."

Armin smiles faintly. "It's not about winning fast. It's about surviving long enough that attacking us stops making sense."

Hange nods. "You're turning fear into math."

"I'm trying," Armin says.

Neither of them mentions Eren.

They don't have to.

### **Inside the Walls - Castle Room (City Hall)**

All three factions of the Paradis military are assembled.

Commanders. Squad leaders. Veterans. Cadets.

It has been years since they've shared the same room without a crisis forcing them into it.

Levi stands as acting commander of the Scouts.

Dot Pyxis represents the Garrison.

Nile Dok sits stiff-backed among the Military Police.

Keith Shadis stands apart from the table; arms crossed, watching the cadets instead of the commanders.

No raised platforms. No banners.

One long table is carved from reclaimed stone.

Levi rests both hands on its surface.

"If you're here to protect your own branch," he says flatly, "leave now."

A few officers shift in their seats.

No one stands.

Dot Pyxis exhales through his nose. "That's a strong way to open a meeting."

"Good," Levi replies. "This isn't a negotiation."

That draws a reaction.

A Garrison officer leans forward. "With respect, Captain, our responsibility is the walls. Not experimental formations dreamed up by-"

"-by people who've actually seen the enemy," Levi cuts in.

Nile Dok clears his throat. "The Military Police were not trained for open warfare. Our duty is internal order. You're asking us to abandon structure."

"Structure didn't stop the capital from burning," someone mutters.

Nile's eyes narrow. "Careful."

Armin steps forward before it escalates.

"We're not asking anyone to abandon their role," he says, calm but firm. "We're asking you to understand that your roles now overlap."

He spreads the maps across the table.

Not battle plans, systems.

"These evacuation routes intersect with firing corridors," Armin continues. "If the Garrison holds here without coordination, civilians die here."

He taps another section.

"If Scouts advance without accounting for airship lines, they get trapped."

Hange leans in, eyes sharp. "And if Military Police units hesitate when command breaks down, gaps will open which then the Titans will exploit."

A Military Police officer scoffs. "You expect us to take orders mid-air?"

"I expect you to think," Levi says coldly. "Orders don't survive first contact."

Keith Shadis finally speaks.

"You're asking soldiers who've been trained to obey structure to act on judgment," he says. "That takes time."

"We have time," Historia says quietly.

The room stills.

She steps forward, not commanding, not pleading.

"When the walls fell before," she continues, "we waited for someone else to handle it. For ranks. For rules."

Her gaze moves across the table.

"People died while we argued about whose responsibility it was."

Silence.

"There are branches," she says. "Different strengths. Different histories."

Then her voice hardens, not loud, but absolute.

"But there are no separate consequences."

She places her hand flat on the table.

"If this fails, no one will care which uniform you wore."

No one speaks.

Dot Pyxis studies the maps again. Slowly. Thoughtfully.

"…If we integrate rotations," he says at last, "the Garrison can adapt."

Nile hesitates. Then nods once. "The Military Police will comply. On the condition that command responsibility is shared."

Levi doesn't smile. "It will be."

Keith Shadis exhales. "Then I'll retrain the cadets."

Historia looks around the table.

"This isn't just unity," she says. "It's accountability. We are embarking to a new structure, eventually all of you must stand besides one another, learn from each other, to protect our land, because once this is over, there won't be a wall."

That settles it.

### The Walls - Movement

Stone groans.

The Colossal Titan moves, slowly, deliberately-guided with precision rather than force. Eren stands on the ground, eyes closed, breathing measured.

He feels every step like pressure against his ribs.

_Gently,_ he thinks. _Just enough._

Below, civilians move through cleared corridors, orderly, calm. No panic. Historia's orders echo through the ranks, clear and firm.

"No pushing. Families stay together. We've drilled this."

She watches everything, listens to complaints, answers questions, reassures where needed; commands where necessary.

This isn't a queen giving speeches.

It's a leader making sure no one is left behind.

With Hange's guidance, Eren raises a new inner wall, part of the island's redesign. A place where civilians can live without fear, while the military prepares beyond it.

### Training Grounds

All military personals arrive and stand in formation

Some of the MPs arrive carrying rifles as they are used to it.

Levi notices immediately.

He doesn't raise his voice.

"You won't need those rifles," he says.

A Military Police officer blinks. "Sir?"

Levi steps closer, eyes cold, assessing. "You will not get enough time to use them."

Silence.

"In this war," Levi continues, "if you're standing still long enough to aim, you're already dead."

A few MPs hesitate. One tightens his grip on the rifle.

Levi doesn't argue.

"Drop them," he says.

They do.

The rifles are set aside, awkward and exposed tools from a different kind of war.

The first drills fail.

Garrison units hold formation too long, waiting for commands that never come.

Scouts surge ahead on instinct, leaving gaps behind them.

Military Police hesitate when orders fracture, eyes searching for authority that no longer exists.

Levi doesn't stop them.

He watches as formations collapse, as ODM lines tangle mid-air, as shouted commands overlap and die unheard.

He lets them fail until frustration replaces pride.

Then he tears everything apart.

Command roles rotate without warning.

Veterans answer rookies.

Orders change mid-air, sometimes vanish entirely.

"Again," Levi says.

They reset.

"Again."

They adjust.

"Again."

This time, differently.

The drills move beyond the yards.

Into the forests.

Into uneven ground where clean formations mean nothing.

Garrison soldiers struggle at first, unused to vertical movement, but Scouts slow their pace, correcting grips, adjusting anchors.

"Use the tree, not the height," Mikasa tells one of them quietly, guiding their line placement.

Military Police units learn to move without waiting, reading hand signals, watching body language instead of rank insignia.

"Left flank's open," a former MP shouts, surprised at himself for noticing first.

"Then move," Jean snaps back, not angry, just urgent.

They do.

Titan dummies are raised among the trees, crude, moving targets dragged along rails.

Blades flash.

Misses are corrected.

Angles refined.

Sasha laughs breathlessly as she lands beside a Garrison soldier, pointing at a weak spot.

"Next time, aim here. Trust me."

He nods, already moving again.

Connie runs drills beside Levi; hard, precise, unforgiving.

"Don't think about killing," Levi tells him. "Think about efficiency."

Connie swallows. Tries again. Gets better.

Jean learns when _not_ to advance.

Armin watches from the edge, quietly adjusting formations between rotations.

Hange scribbles notes, already revising layouts based on what fails.

Levi Squad drills relentlessly; pair formations, breakaways, re-engagements.

Blades clash until hands shake.

ODM lines snap and are rethreaded.

Bruises accumulate.

Conversations happen between breaths.

The other factions catch up to them.

"Didn't think MPs could keep up," someone mutters.

"Didn't think Scouts knew how to wait," comes the reply.

By the time the drills end for the day, no one remembers which unit they started in.

Only who's beside them.

#### Euthanasia

Zeke Yaegar sent envoys to discuss his plan with Eren Yaeger.

The meeting happens away from the walls.

No soldiers.

No weapons drawn.

Three figures stand across from Eren, Eldians marked by Marley, speaking not as warriors, but as believers.

They tell him about **Zeke Yeager**.

About a plan to end the suffering of Eldians forever.

No more Titans.

No more internment zones.

No more children born into hatred.

Only silence.

Only an ending.

"You're the key," one of them says. "With the Founder and royal blood, this can be done peacefully."

Eren listens without interrupting.

When they finish, the wind fills the space between them.

"You want to save the world," Eren says slowly. "By making sure no one is left in it."

They flinch.

"Life without choice isn't mercy," he continues. "It's just another form of control."

One of them steps forward. "Then the cycle will never end."

Eren meets their gaze.

"No," he says. "It ends when people are allowed to choose differently."

Silence.

"You should leave," Eren adds. "And don't come back with this idea again."

They hesitate, then bow.

Not in respect.

In understanding.

As they walk away, Levi exhales quietly.

"So," he mutters. "That's your brother."

Eren doesn't look back.

"He's tired," Eren says. "But that doesn't give him the right to decide the future for everyone else."

#### Sparing

Jean knocks Eren flat, again.

"Still relying on Titan instincts," Jean mutters.

Eren groans. "I know."

Levi trains Connie personally; hard, efficient, and merciless.

"You fight like someone who expects to survive," Levi tells Connie. "Fight like someone who can't afford mistakes."

They drill until exhaustion erases rank.

Until movement becomes instinct.

Until no one needs to shout commands anymore.

### The Wall at Dusk

Mikasa stands beside Eren, watching the horizon burn orange.

"I'm scared," she says quietly.

Eren doesn't pretend otherwise. "Me too."

She looks at him. "Not of dying."

"I know."

She hesitates. "If things go wrong… don't push yourself just to protect us."

Eren turns toward her.

For a moment, the world narrows; not to fear, not to power, but to her presence beside him.

"I'm not doing this alone anymore," he says.

He means more than strategy.

Mikasa seems to sense it but doesn't press.

Armin joins them, leaning against the railing.

"Do you remember when all we wanted was to see what was outside the walls?"

Eren smiles faintly. "Feels stupid now."

"No," Armin says. "It's why we're here."

Levi watches from a distance.

He says nothing.

Later, as they prepare to leave, Eren stops Armin.

"If you ever want to go out," Eren says quietly. "I can take it away."

Armin, "Out?"

Eren, "The Colossal Titan, if you don't need it."

Armin, "…Not yet," he says. "But thank you. For giving me the choice."

Eren nods.

Choice matters now.

### The Ethereal Plane - One Last Time That Night

Ymir hums softly as Historia shows her how to shape sand into flowers.

Eren watches from beneath the glowing tree.

For the first time, the power inside him didn't press outward.

It waits.

Meanwhile inside the walls, Armin explains the plans to Annie, hoping her not to fight back.

### After 1 and a half year

The work is finished.

The inner wall stands, lower, broader, layered with crystallized stone and steel. Artillery embedded seamlessly. Signal towers aligned to sightlines practiced a hundred times over.

Beyond it, an outer wall stretches across the landscape; vast, deliberate, built to endure.

This isn't a wall of fear.

It's a wall of intent.

Levi Squad stands atop it, Historia among them.

Below, soldiers, engineers, and scouts stand in formation.

No branches.

Historia steps forward.

"This will hold," she says.

Not as hope, but as a fact.

Eren looks out over Paradis.

The land isn't just safer.

It's ready.

For a moment,

There is peace.

### Transitions to present

Eren and his team are looking towards the Marleyan Airships, and it is followed by a Tybur Family's airship. Eren is waiting for Reiner to show up, as he is waiting for his final dual.

---

## CHAPTER 5: WAR

### Phase 1

The sky hums.

Eren stands atop the inner wall, cloak snapping against his legs as the Marleyan airships drift closer, their silhouettes cutting through the clouds like knives. His eyes track the lead vessel; not the soldiers moving along its deck, not the artillery lining its underside.

He's waiting for one person.

Below him, the battlefield lies quiet. Too quiet.

Porco Galliard drops first.

A dark shape falling fast, parachute snapping open moments before impact. Pieck follows soon after; her descent controlled, deliberate, followed by a cargo containing her weapons as well as her weapon unit. They separate midair, drifting toward opposite sectors, exactly where Eren expected them to go.

He exhales.

"Positions," Eren says into the signal flare communicator.

Across the wall and ground, figures move instantly. The Levi Squad vanishes into shadowed angles. Survey Corps detach into vertical layers. Garrison and Military Police scatter into preassigned zones; weapons ready, ODM lines primed.

No hesitation.

No questions.

The airship doors open again.

Reiner thinking, "ODM gear? Out here? How are they planning to use here?"

Reiner jumps.

For a moment, he's just a falling man, arms spread, eyes fixed forward.

Then lightning tears the sky apart.

The Armored Titan slams into the earth, stone exploding outward as the impact ripples across the ground. Reiner rises taller, broader, the plates along his body denser than before. He feels heavier. Stronger.

He looks up.

Eren hasn't moved.

_"Good_," Reiner thinks. "_He's not using it."_

Relief flickers through him, short-lived, but real.

Eren steps forward.

Not rushing. Not transforming yet.

Reiner narrows his eyes. "You're going to face me like this?"

Eren smirks. Two poles appear in front of him from the ground.

He takes a jump using the ODM gears and the poles to pull himself forward.

In the air, from his coat pocket, he pulls a small vial-glass reinforced, liquid inside faintly glowing.

Historia's blood.

He doesn't look back at the wall.

He doesn't hesitate.

He bites the vial, drinking the blood.

The transformation begins, not violently, but _cleanly_.

Flesh forms. Muscle locks into place. Bone reshapes.

The Attack Titan rises, broader than before, frame reinforced, posture unnervingly stable. No roar. No rage.

Just control.

Reiner braces himself.

The Marleyan Army began to jump from the airships, taking the lead of their commander.

Eren lands; he looks at Armor Titan and walks towards him.

After a few moments, as the Attack Titan crossed half the distance, then,

Movement.

From behind.

We hear two transformations. The Jaw Titan erupts from the ground at Eren's nape, claws snapping forward. The Cart Titan bursts through rubble from the opposite side, mounted weapons already turning, aiming at his legs.

A perfect pincer.

A textbook execution.

Reiner's breath catches. _They planned this._

Eren doesn't turn.

The ground _answers_ instead.

Crystal spikes tear upward without warning, brutal, precise. One impales the Jaw Titan through the torso, lifting Porco off the ground mid-leap. Another skewers the Cart Titan's legs, pinning Pieck in place before her weapons can fire.

Shock freezes them both.

"What!" Porco and Pieck gasps.

Reiner stares in shock.

"That's impossible," he mutters. "The War Hammer,"

Cracks spread across Eren's Titan.

Not fractures.

_Plates._

Armor like crystal grows outward from his body, interlocking seamlessly over muscle and sinew, lighter than Reiner's, denser than steel. A fusion. Not imitation.

Eren clenches his fists and bumps at each other.

The ground trembles.

He looks straight at Reiner and screams,

"Is that all you've got?"

His voice isn't distorted.

It's clear.

Reiner is frozen in fear. He could not process what he just saw; he knew how hardening works but is not like that. It's like Armor Titan and Attack Titan fused together, becoming something ultimate.

Inside the inner wall through the window, Hange and Armin are looking at the battlefield and operating it. Hange activates the grid button as she screams, "That's right you bastards."

Reiner feels it then, the pressure beneath his feet.

Crystal pillars erupt across the battlefield in a grid, rising at calculated intervals, followed by mid-range columns between the large columns and urban-block simulations, making a perfect battleground for ODM users. ODM lines snap onto them instantly. Soldiers swing, dive, strike, turning the terrain itself into a weapon.

The Marleyan ground forces break formation, as they began to get impaled mid-air before getting a chance.

Too late.

Reiner tightens his stance, armor locking into place as Eren advances.

He still doesn't understand how.

He only understands one thing.

This isn't an ambush.

This is a declaration.

And Eren Yeager is ready to meet him head-on.

### Phase 2

The impact is immediate.

Eren and Reiner collide like colliding walls, fists slamming into armor, shockwaves tearing through the reinforced ground. Stone fractures beneath their feet, crystal pillars shuddering but holding, doing exactly what Armin designed them to do: channel force without collapsing.

Reiner swings first.

The Armored Titan's fist crashes into Eren's side, sending him skidding across the grid. Eren plants his heel against a crystal column, pivots, and drives forward, shoulder first, slamming into Reiner's chest. Armor plates crack, but hold.

They exchange blows in brutal rhythm.

No finesse.

No hesitation.

Just memory, rage, and restraint colliding.

Above them, the battlefield moves.

Jean and Connie are doing their job clearing enemies near Eren, and Sasha is backing them up as their sniper inside from a hole in a wall way above.

The factions are working in unity to kill any enemy insight.

#### Ackermans vs Quadruples

The Jaw Titan hits the ground hard, claws digging into broken stone as Porco drags himself upright. Steam pours from cracks in his torso; regeneration still catching up from Eren's sudden counter.

The Cart Titan shifts nearby, legs bracing as Pieck reorients her mounted frame, eyes scanning the battlefield.

They don't get long to think.

Crystal structures rise around them, not randomly, not violently, but **precisely**.  
Mid-range columns lock into place.  
Urban-block simulations follow, closing gaps, narrowing lanes.

The battlefield tightens.

Porco bares his teeth. "Tch-trying to box us in?"

Pieck's eyes narrow. "No. They're shaping us."

A shadow passes overhead.

Mikasa drops first.

The Thunder Spear leaves her hand mid-fall, spinning once before slamming into the ground between the two Titans. The explosion doesn't aim to kill, it **forces separation**.

Porco is blasted forward.  
Pieck is driven backward.

Exactly as intended.

Smoke billows.

Two figures land lightly in front of them.

Blades drawn.  
Gas hissing.

Levi Ackerman stands where Porco is now facing, backed by dense urban blocks and narrow corridors.

Mikasa Ackerman stands opposite Pieck, open ground behind her, columns arranged like retreat lanes.

Levi speaks without looking away, "Don't waste the spears."

"So," he says, voice distorted but sharp, "you're the infamous Ackermans."

Pieck adjusts her stance. "We won't reach Braun unless we get past them."

Porco cracks his neck, claws flexing.

"So be it."

He lowers himself, muscles coiling.

"Let's see if you really match a Titan."

He charges.

Porco moves first, fast, feral, body low as he launches forward; jaws snapping wide.

Levi doesn't move.

Not yet.

At the last second, Levi sidesteps, ODM lines snapping into a nearby block. He pulls Porco **past him**, not away, into the urban structures.

Porco crashes through stone, claws scraping walls too close together for full momentum.

Levi follows.

Now Porco is forced to turn.  
To crouch.  
To react.

Levi is everywhere.

He doesn't strike to kill, only to **redirect**.  
A cut to the shoulder.  
A slice across hardened plating.  
A kickoff a wall that forces Porco deeper into the maze.

Porco roars in frustration. "Hold still!"

Levi vanishes upward, gas clicking once.

Porco realizes too late.

This isn't just a duel.

It's containment.

On the opposite side,

Pieck pulls back instinctively, weapons swiveling toward Mikasa.

Mikasa lets her.

She runs forward just long enough to draw fire, bullets chewing the ground, then fires her ODM line sideways, pulling herself into a column cluster.

Pieck tracks her. Retreating.

Good.

Mikasa swings wide, staying just out of reach, always visible, always retreating **toward open lanes that narrow behind the Cart Titan**.

Pieck feels it.

"These structures…" she mutters. "They're steering me."

Too late.

Mikasa fires upward, swings over Pieck's frame, and lands on the mounted weapon, not to destroy it, but to **force Pieck forward**.

Pieck bucks, slamming into a pillar.

The pillar doesn't break.

The Cart Titan stumbles.

Mikasa drops, slicing clean through a joint in the mounting rig, then darts away, never lingering.

The weapon crashes uselessly to the ground.

Pieck hisses. "Efficient."

Mikasa is already gone.

The Cart Titan tries to turn.

There's no room.

Porco lunges again.

This time, Levi didn't sidestep.

The Jaw Titan's claws snap forward with terrifying speed, too fast for hesitation. Levi fires his ODM lines instantly, not to retreat, but to **brace**, pulling himself into Porco's trajectory.

Steel meets hardened claws.

The impact _throws Levi sideways_.

He skids along a wall, boots scraping stone, gas hissing hard as he stabilizes.

Porco doesn't let up.

He pivots mid-charge, tailing Levi with frightening precision. His jaws snap shut inches from Levi's head, the air cracking with the force.

"Got you!"

Levi twists, barely clearing the bite as the Jaw Titan's teeth shear through stone instead.

That was close.

Too close.

Porco is smiling now.

"Thought so," he snarls. "You're fast, but I'm built for this."

He springs again, faster than before, claws striking in rapid succession. Levi blocks it and the force rattles his arms.

This isn't a lumbering Titan.

This is a predator.

Levi fires upward, Porco following instantly, claws digging into a pillar as he **climbs**, keeping pace.

They move together now.

Up.  
Across.  
Through the urban blocks.

Levi cuts across Porco's forearm, shallow, but enough to disrupt balance.

Porco answers by **swiping midair**, clipping Levi's harness and tearing part of it loose.

Levi spins hard, gas flaring as he corrects.

So that's how it is.

Levi doesn't disengage.

He accelerates.

For a moment, it's pure speed, steel and claws crossing too fast for anyone else to follow. Levi strikes; Porco counters. Porco lunges; Levi pivots.

Equal reaction time.  
Equal aggression.

But space is shrinking.

Porco clips a corner, just slightly.

Levi doesn't miss it.

He changes angles instantly, forcing Porco deeper between the blocks. The Jaw Titan tries to leap wide, there isn't room.

Porco snarls, frustration bleeding into his movements.

"You planned this," he realizes.

Levi doesn't answer.

Porco lunges again, desperate, furious.

Levi lets him come.

At the last second, Levi drops low, anchors a blade into the ground, and swings _around_ Porco's charge, riding the Titan's own momentum.

Porco turns too late.

Levi drives his blade into the Jaw Titan's eye socket.

Porco screams, not in pain alone, but in rage.

Levi doesn't finish him.

He pulls out instantly, retreating into the vertical maze.

Porco staggers, clutching his face, breathing hard.

For the first time, he understands.

This wasn't about speed.

It wasn't about strength.

It was about **where** they were fighting.

Porco looks around.

Walls are too close.  
Angles are too tight.  
Routes Levi knows by heart.

"Damn it…" he growls.

Levi's voice drifts from above, calm and cold.

"You're fast," he says.  
"But this ground isn't yours."

Porco roars and charges again, and the trap tightens.

#### Back to war

On the ground, Marleyan infantry breaks formation.

The terrain betrays them at every step, narrow lanes, sudden elevation changes, blind angles that turn into death traps. Survey Corps soldiers swing from pillar to pillar, striking and retreating before Marley can regroup.

Artillery fire rains down, but the angles are wrong.

The battlefield belongs to Paradis.

Reiner roars and charges again.

Eren meets him head-on.

Their fists collide mid-air, bone against crystal-reinforced muscle. Eren twists, hooks Reiner's arm, and slams a punch straight into his face.

Armor shatters.

Reiner staggers.

Eren doesn't let up.

Another punch. Then another.

The Armored Titan collapses to one knee, head snapping back as Eren drives a final blow straight through the cracked plating.

Reiner hits the ground hard.

For a fraction of a second,

Silence.

Then,

A scream tears through the air.

A crystal arrow punches through Eren's arm, ripping it clean off at the shoulder. The limb spins away, dissolving mid-air.

The War Hammer Titan stands at the edge of the battlefield, weapon already reforming.

Reiner reacts instantly.

He surges forward, tackling Eren to the ground, pinning him beneath his weight. His remaining armor grinds against Eren's chest as he raises his fist.

Reiner, "This ends now,"

But before he could land the punch, A thunderous crack interrupts him.

A Thunder Spear slams directly into Reiner's exposed face.

The explosion rips him backward, armor detonating outward as the Armored Titan crashes onto his back, stunned.

Smoke clears.

Jean stands on a crystal ridge, launcher still smoking.

"Next time," he mutters, "aim faster."

Eren pushes himself up.

Steam pours from his shoulder as muscle and bone regenerate, crystal reinforcement forming last-controlled, precise.

He doesn't look at Reiner.

His attention is already on the War Hammer.

Eren raises his intact arm.

The flesh reshapes.

Hardens.

The forearm expands and locks into a mini gun, crystal lattice humming as it rotates.

He fires.

Crystal shards fired by Eren strikes to War Hammer Titan, detonating crystal defenses and throwing her backward through a line of pillars. She retaliates instantly, spikes, hammers, and blades erupting from the ground.

Eren dodges.

Steps through the chaos.

Closes the distance.

He pulls back his fist,

And charges.

Two monsters collide again.

This time,

It's something else entirely.

### Phase 3

The War Hammer does not retreat.

She answers force with annihilation.

Crystal erupts in every direction, spears, hammers, whips tearing through the air with surgical precision. Eren moves through it, not faster, but _earlier_, anticipating the angles before they fully form. A hammer crashes where his head had been a moment ago; he steps into the gap and drives a knee into the War Hammer's torso, shattering layered crystal and sending fragments screaming across the field.

She reforms instantly.

A blade grows from her arm, slashing downward. Eren catches it with his forearm, crystal grinding against crystal, then twists, snapping the weapon apart and ramming his shoulder into her core.

She gets slammed but immediately rolls back up.

They trade blows that flatten the battlefield.

Each strike sends shockwaves rippling through the reinforced grid, pillars cracking but holding. The War Hammer adapts, changing shapes mid-motion, growing weapons faster, harder, sharper.

Eren adapts faster.

He stops targeting the Titan.

He targets the ground.

Crystal spikes burst upward beneath her feet, destabilizing her stance. Eren lunges, driving both hands into her legs, pins her down, and then exposes her weakness, not flesh, not armor,

A cocoon.

He rips it free from the earth in one brutal motion.

The crystal pod dangles in his grip, still connected to her left leg by a long, hardened umbilical cord stretching back into the ground.

The War Hammer's Titan convulses.

Eren stares at the cocoon, breathing heavily, steam pouring from his frame.

"I know how you fight," he mutters. "Hiding away from your body."

He yanks the cord.

It snaps with a sound like breaking glass.

The War Hammer's Titan freezes, then collapses.

Eren stands there, cocoon clenched in his fist.

For a moment, he doesn't know what to do.

Then,

A deafening crack.

An Anti-Titan shell screams across the battlefield and slams directly into Eren's hand.

The explosion is violent.

Crystal shatters.

The cocoon disintegrates instantly reduced to fragments and dust in a flash of fire and steel.

Eren's entire palm is blown away.

The War Hammer is dead.

Silence falls, sharp, stunned.

Eren looks up.

High atop the wall, smoke curling around the barrel, Magath stands beside the artillery, already reloading. He was covered by a few soldiers, because of that Sasha wasn't able to take a shot.

No hesitation.

No remorse.

Eren's eyes burn.

"They never cared," he growls. "Not about anyone."

Rage surges, not wild, not blind, but focused.

Deadly.

From his remaining arm, crystal flows and reshapes, stretching outward into a massive bow. He instantly heals his fist enough to pull back an arrow formed of compressed crystal and intent.

Aims.

Screams as he pulls, then releases.

The arrow tears through the air and punches straight through the artillery emplacement.

Through Magath.

The explosion swallows the platform.

The wall falls silent.

Eren exhales slowly as steam pours from his shoulder, muscle and bone already reforming; crystal following last, methodical, controlled.

Behind him, Reiner watches in horror as his own body struggles to heal, armor sluggish, head regenerating piece by piece.

_"Why…_ he thinks. _Why isn't he slowing down?_

_He's using power far beyond his limits."_

And yet,

Eren stands.

Elsewhere, the battle tightens.

Porco is slammed into the ground, blades pinning his limbs before he can recover. Levi lands beside him without a word, driving steel deep and precisely.

Pieck tries to crawl back, body broken, transformation stalled.

Mikasa is already there.

They are restrained.

Neutralized.

Alive.

For now.

Levi looks up.

Too late.

The ground ahead erupts.

The front wall collapses inward as artillery fire tears it apart. Tanks surge through the breach; steel treads crush debris beneath them.

And leading them,

A familiar shape charges forward.

The Beast Titan.

Zeke.

The battlefield shudders anew.

Levi's eyes are narrow.

"This isn't over," he says quietly.

Not even close.

### Phase 4

The ground trembles again.

This time, it isn't crystal.

It's steel.

The front-line collapses under the roar of engines as Marleyan tanks surge through the breach, treads crushing debris and bodies alike. Anti-Titan artillery opens fire in unison, shells screaming across the battlefield.

Crystal pillars shatter.

The grid breaks.

Explosions tear through Paradis formations, sending soldiers flying, ODM lines snapping mid-air. Smoke and fire swallow the lower ground as screams cut through the noise.

The tide shifts-fast.

At the center of it all, the Beast Titan, moving forward.

Zeke straightens, surveying the field with practiced calm… then frowns.

No movement from the walls.

No marching shadows.

No Colossal Titans.

His eyes are narrow.

_"That's not possible."_

_"Where are they?_" He mutters.

All the artilleries aiming towards Eren, as if one man is about to fight an entire battalion who can erase him from the face of the world even if he twitches.

Eren stands still in the same position he was before, steam rising from his body, chest heaving as he steadies his breath. He doesn't move. He doesn't react.

He waits.

Inside his mind, his voice is quiet, but resolute.

_"It's time, fallen heroes."_

The ground beneath the tanks ripples.

Zeke's eyes widen.

"Wait,"

The earth erupts.

Colossal Titans burst upward from beneath the battlefield, massive arms impaling tanks mid-charge. Steel is crushed like paper. Explosions bloom uselessly against flesh that doesn't flinch.

Marley's armored spearhead is annihilated in seconds.

Zeke stares as his army is flanked _from below_.

"…No," he whispers. "That's,"

A shot rings out.

A single, precise crack.

The bullet slams into the Beast Titan's neck, snapping his head sideways and throwing his massive body off balance.

Sasha lowers her Anti-Titan rifle, breath steady.

"Got you," she mutters.

Before Zeke can recover,

Connie is already there.

He moves faster than reason allows, ODM gear screaming as he rockets upward, blades flashing, spinning like a top. He carves straight through the Beast Titan's nape, tearing muscle apart before regeneration can keep up.

Zeke tries to scream.

Connie jams his blade straight into the Beast Titan's mouth.

"Shut up."

He doesn't stop.

He drives blow after blow into the exposed flesh, fury replacing exhaustion, grief replacing fear.

Levi is watching this unfold, remembering Connie asking him to teach him to use the blades the way he does. Now his hard work is paying off.

Connie in his mind, _"This is for Ragako."_

With a final wrench, Connie severs control and drags Zeke's human body free, hauling him through the air toward the rear lines, toward Levi, where the other captured Warriors are restrained and waiting.

Zeke can't scream.

He can't command.

He can only watch the battlefield fall apart.

Eren sees it all.

The plan unfolding exactly as intended.

Reiner does not.

Armor plates crack as Reiner forces himself upright, disbelief giving way to desperation. His breathing is ragged; vision blurred, but his resolve burns hotter than ever.

"I can't lose," he growls. "Not now. Not like this."

He charges.

Straight at Eren.

Eren doesn't turn fully.

The ground answers him instead.

A crystal spike erupts upward, piercing clean through the Armored Titan's face and his torso, shattering what remains of his helmet and stopping him dead.

Reiner staggers.

Before he can recover, Eren is behind him.

One hand clamps onto the back of the Armored Titan's head.

The other grips the nape.

With a brutal pull, crystal and flesh tear apart as Eren rips Reiner free from his Titan, severing the connection in one decisive motion.

The Armored Titan collapses.

Eren is holding Reiner in his fist.

"The war is over," Eren says, voice low, unwavering.

He turns slightly, glancing toward where Levi stands with the restrained Warriors.

"Come," he continues. "I want to talk to you and your friends about something."

Reiner stares up at him, chest heaving, the battlefield burning around them.

For the first time since he became a Warrior,

He doesn't know what comes next.

And that terrifies him more than defeat.

### Phase 5

The battlefield is silent.

Smoke drifts lazily across broken ground; crystal shards catch the light like frozen stars. The air smells of scorched metal and salt carried inland from the coast.

Marleyan soldiers kneel in long rows, **not only those who landed first, but the remnants of entire battalions pulled from the shoreline and surrounding plains**. Disarmed. Exhausted. Guarded on all sides.

Some still wear naval insignia.  
Others bear the dust and scorch marks of artillery positions that no longer exist.

No one fights anymore.  
No one even speaks.

Beyond the broken ground, the **airships lie wrecked or grounded**, their advance halted hours ago, cut off by the collapsing grid, flanked by Titans emerging from beneath the earth, and overwhelmed by Paradis forces that moved faster than any projection had allowed.

Every route inward has been sealed.  
Every remaining unit has surrendered.

At the front stand the Warriors.

Reiner.

Zeke.

Porco.

Pieck.

Colt.

Their eyes are fixed forward, waiting.

Footsteps echo.

Hitch steps into view, pushing another figure ahead of her.

Annie Leonhart.

For a moment, no one breathes.

Reiner's knees nearly give out. Porco stares as if he's seeing a ghost. Pieck's eyes widen, then soften, then harden again.

"…Annie?" Reiner whispers.

She doesn't answer.  
She just looks at them, older, quieter, and unmistakably real.

Everyone expects death.

Then,

The Attack Titan collapses.

Its massive body cracks, dissolving into steam and light, scattering into nothing. From the fading remains, a single figure steps forward.

Eren Yeager.

The Marleyan Warriors freeze.

Something is wrong.

Eren's eyes glow, not brightly, not violently, but impossibly deep, as if galaxies swirl behind them. Infinite. Watching.

Understanding hits them all at once.

_That's why._

Eren walks closer.

Before he can speak, a Marleyan officer shouts from the rear ranks, one of many dragged inland after the coastal route.

"You think you've won?" He snarls. "As long as you devils exist, we'll keep coming! You must be erased from this world!"

Cheers erupt behind him, ragged, desperate, hollow.

Reiner's expression twists.

Not fear.

Disgust.

Eren stops.

"I know," he says calmly. "That's why we decided something."

The laughter dies.

"When I die," Eren continues, "my power will not return to the cycle. The Founding Titan will cease to exist. Along with it, the power of all Titans."

Murmurs ripple through the crowd.

"Don't bluff," a soldier scoffs. "Fairy tales,"

"Jean. Connie," Eren says quietly.

They move instantly, cutting the restraints from the Warriors.

Porco steps back, instinctively biting his hand,

Blood spills.

Nothing happens.

His eyes widen.

_"Why…?_  
_Why am I not transforming?"_

Eren meets his gaze.

"I've returned your power to the Founder," he says. "You're free. All of you. The curse is gone."

Porco stares at his bleeding hand.

Reiner's breath shatters.

"That means…" His voice cracks. "You're carrying it alone."

Eren doesn't deny it.

Tears streak down Reiner's face. So do Pieck's. Colt looks away, shoulders shaking.

The officer roars again. "What are you waiting for, you devil children?! Kill him!"

Reiner snaps.

He turns and kicks the man hard in the stomach, sending him crashing to the ground.

"Shut up!" Reiner screams. "Just shut up!"

Soldiers shout in outrage.

Porco steps forward. "It's okay, Reiner," he says quietly. "You finally stopped acting like a coward."

Zeke stares at Eren, eyes hollow.

"Brother," he asks softly. "Isn't there any other way?"

Eren closes his eyes.

"I wish there was," he says. "But I made a promise… to a little girl."

### **The Ethereal Plane**

Ymir stands beneath the tree of light, holding Eren's hand.

She's crying.

She's smiling.

For the first time, free.

Eren turns back to the fallen officer and lifts him effortlessly.

"Listen to me," Eren says, voice cold and absolute.

"You will return home. You will free every nation you've conquered. You will end your oppression of Eldians."

The officer trembles.

"If you don't," Eren continues, "your nation will be the one conquered next."

Silence.

The officer nods frantically. "We… we agree."

Eren releases him.

"Hange," he says, turning away. "Treat the prisoners. Prepare their escort home."

Around them, **Paradis soldiers begin organizing the captured forces, coastal battalions, artillery crews, command officers, into guarded columns**, moving with discipline born not of hatred, but certainty.

As the Marleyan army is led away, Reiner steps forward once more.

"Wait," he says. "You could have taken our powers from the beginning. Why didn't you?"

Eren stops, but doesn't turn.

"Because I don't control people's will," he replies.

"And also, I wanted you to know something."

He looks back.

"Even at your strongest… we can stop you. Take it as a reminder, if your nation tries to break our agreement."

Eren walks away.

Reiner sinks to his knees.

_I was wrong,_ he realizes.

_About everything._

---

## CHAPTER 6: END OF THE GENERATIONAL SORROW

Eren takes one step toward Armin and collapses.

Armin barely has time to react before Eren's weight crashes into him. He catches him, arms trembling, heart pounding as steam rises faintly from Eren's skin.

"Eren!"

Eren's body is exhausted. Not injured. _Spent._

Somewhere far beyond the battlefield, Ymir releases her hold.

Eren exhales slowly.

Inside the silence of the Ethereal Plane, he whispers, "We'll meet again."

The light fades.

His eyes return to normal.

Armin holds him tighter. "You've done enough," he says, voice breaking.

"Rest easy."

### **Two Days Later**

Eren wakes up in quiet breathing.

Mikasa is asleep in the chair beside him, head resting against the bedframe; fingers still curled around his hand; as if letting go might make him disappear.

Eren smiles.

He shifts slightly.

Her eyes snap open.

For a moment, she just stares at him, frozen-like she's afraid the movement is a trick.

Then she cries. Laughing. Hugging him so tightly, it almost hurts.

"I thought you-" Her voice breaks. She pulls back just enough to look at his face, searching for something solid. "I thought I lost you."

"I'm still here," Eren says quietly.

She exhales shakily, forehead resting against his shoulder, breathing him in like she needs proof.

Later, when the room has gone still again, the silence grows heavier than before.

Eren stares at the ceiling for a long moment.

There's something he's been holding back not because he didn't want to say it, but because he was afraid of what the answer might take from her.

"Mikasa," he says at last.

She looks up immediately.

"How do you really feel about me?"

She stiffens up.

He turns his head toward her; voice careful not pleading, not demanding.

"Not because of duty," he adds. "Not because of blood. I don't want something you feel forced to carry. I want to know _you_."

Mikasa looks away.

For a second, Eren thinks he's made a mistake.

Then she speaks.

"I questioned it," she says quietly. "More times than I can count. I was scared that it wasn't real. Scared that if it was… I'd lose you anyway."

She looks back at him, eyes steady now.

"But even when I tried to push it away," she continued, "it never changed. I love you. Not because I had to. Because I chose to."

Eren's breath catches.

For the first time in a long while, he doesn't feel like he has to earn the right to exist.

"I feel the same way," he says softly. "I just needed to know we were standing in the same place."

Mikasa's lips tremble.

She laughs quietly through tears.

Eren reaches up, resting his forehead against hers.

She leans into it immediately, as if the space between them had always been waiting to close.

They stay like that.

Breathing.

Crying.

Smiling.

No promises are spoken.

No moments rushed.

Just two people, who are finally allowed to feel what they've carried for years.

The door opens.

Jean steps inside-mid-sentence-then stops.

He freezes.

His eyes flick from Eren to Mikasa.

Then he clears his throat and looks away.

"…I'm gonna," he says, gesturing vaguely toward the hall, "give you some time."

Connie peeks around him, takes one look, and grins.

"Ohhh," he says knowingly. "So _that's_ what this is."

Sasha smiles softer than usual. "This is so amazing!"

Armin stands quietly in the doorway.

He doesn't interrupt.

He just exhales, relief settling into his shoulders as if something long overdue has finally fallen into place.

Levi clicks his tongue.

"…About damn time," he mutters, turning away.

Eren and Mikasa startles and move away a little after seeing the others.

But Mikasa doesn't let his hand go.

If anything, she holds his hand a little tighter.

### **After the War**

The island gathers in silence.

No banners. No speeches.

Names are read aloud instead.

Soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder as the wind moves through the trees, carrying the sound across the rebuilt ground. Some names are answered by quiet sobs. Others by nothing at all.

Even the Marleyan Warriors bow their heads.

No one stops them.

No one questions it.

Loss, at least, is universal.

Levi Squad meets up near a campfire.

The fire burns low, steady rather than bright.

Eren sits with his squad in a loose circle, tin cups warming their hands. Mikasa sitting next to him, holding his arm, laying her head on his shoulder. No one speaks much. The memorial still hangs over them, not like grief, but like something unfinished.

The crackle of wood is the loudest sound.

Then footsteps.

Levi notices first. He doesn't react, just watches.

Eren looks up.

Reiner stands at the edge of the firelight, posture unsure, hands visible. Pieck and Porco linger behind him. Annie stands a little apart. Zeke and Colt remain farther back, waiting.

For a moment, no one says anything.

The fire pops.

Reiner clears his throat. "We didn't mean to intrude."

Jean exhales slowly. "You're already here."

Reiner nods once. "We thought… it might be easier to talk like this. Not standing in lines. Not pretending we're still on opposite sides."

Silence follows; not hostile, just heavy.

Eren shifts, then sets his cup down and stands. He gestures toward the fire.

"You can sit," he says. "If you want."

Reiner hesitates, then steps forward. The others follow; carefully, like they're testing the ground. They don't cross fully into the circle. They stop just short.

"That's close enough," Connie mutters, then winces. "I mean yeah. Sit."

Porco snorts. "Still charming."

Jean shoots him a look. "Careful."

Pieck lowers herself near the fire, stretching her legs toward the warmth. Annie remains standing a moment longer before sitting, back straight, eyes on the flames.

No one offers food. No one refuses it either.

Reiner stares into the fire.

"I don't expect forgiveness," he says quietly. "I don't even know what that would look like anymore."

Jean's jaw tightens. "Good. Because we're not there."

Reiner nods. "I figured."

Mikasa steps closer to Eren, not in front of him, not behind him. Just beside.

Pieck speaks next, voice calm. "It's strange," she says. "Standing here without orders. Without knowing what we're supposed to be."

Armin looks up from the fire. "That might be the point."

Annie glances at him, then away. "I didn't think I'd be allowed to sit here."

"You are," Eren says. Not permission. Statement.

The fire shifts. Sparks rise.

Connie rubs his hands together. "For what it's worth… I hated you. All of you. Thought about it every day."

Porco lets out a breath that almost sounds like a laugh. "Good. Would've felt wrong otherwise."

That cracks something.

Not laughter, release.

Reiner looks at Eren then. Really looks at him.

"I don't know how to live without being punished for it," he admits.

Eren meets his gaze. "Neither do I."

He pauses.

"But we don't have to figure it out alone."

Reiner nods once, slow and deliberate.

It isn't absolution.

It isn't peace.

But no one stands up to leave.

Levi finally turns away from the fire, satisfied.

The night deepens. Someone adds another log. The circle widens by inches, not enough to forget the past, but enough to share the warmth.

Enemies once.

Survivors now.

And for tonight, that's enough.

The fire has burned down to embers.

Most of the camp sleeps now, scattered bedrolls catching faint orange light. Eren sits alone on a fallen log, watching ash drift upward and vanish.

Footsteps approach.

Zeke stops a short distance away.

"You don't mind?" he asks.

Eren doesn't look up. "No."

Zeke sits, careful to leave space between them.

They don't speak for a while.

Finally, Zeke exhales. "I spent most of my life thinking the only way to end this was to make sure it never continued."

Eren nods slightly. "I know."

"I was so certain," Zeke continues. "So convinced I was being merciful." He lets out a short, humorless laugh. "Turns out I was just tired."

Eren glances at him then. "That doesn't make you evil."

Zeke studies the fire. "It doesn't make me right either."

Silence settles again.

"You could've erased us," Zeke says quietly. "Taken everything. Forced peace."

Eren's voice is calm. "That wouldn't have been peace."

Zeke looks at him. Really looks at him.

"You always chose the harder path," he says. "Even when you didn't know where it led."

Eren shrugs. "I just didn't want to decide for everyone else."

Zeke nods slowly.

"I think… that's where we were different."

He stands after a moment.

"For what it's worth," he says, not quite meeting Eren's eyes, "I'm glad it was you."

Eren doesn't respond right away.

Then: "Me too."

Zeke leaves.

Eren stays, watching the embers fade until there's nothing left to burn.

Zeke pauses as he turns to leave.

"There's something I wanted to ask," he says.

Eren looks up.

"My father," Zeke continues. "Grisha. What was he like to you?"

Eren doesn't answer immediately.

He watches the embers, the way they glow briefly before collapsing into ash.

"He was gentle," Eren says at last. "Clumsy. He worried too much."

A faint smile tugs at his lips. "He tried to protect us from things he didn't understand himself."

Zeke listens closely.

"He loved my mother," Eren continues. "And he loved me. Not because I was useful. Just because I existed."

Zeke exhales slowly.

"That's not how I remember him."

Eren doesn't look away.

"To me," Zeke says, "he was desperate. Angry. Always talking about futures that needed sacrifices. He didn't ask what I wanted. He told me what I was supposed to become."

He clenches his jaw.

"When you saw his memories… you probably saw him as a victim. Someone crushed by the world."

Eren glances at him then. "I saw that."

Zeke nods. "But to me, he was also the one who made choices for me before I was old enough to understand them."

Silence stretches between them.

"I didn't really have a choice," Zeke says quietly. "Not then. Not later. So I chose my own way to end it. I told myself it was mercy."

He looks down at his hands.

"I know you must've seen it as betrayal."

Eren thinks for a moment.

"I didn't see it as betrayal," he says. "I saw it as someone trying to escape pain by erasing the future."

Zeke's shoulders tense-but Eren continues.

"I get why you did it," he adds. "I just couldn't accept deciding that for everyone else."

Zeke lets out a slow breath.

"I think," he says, "that's where our father failed both of us. He tried to make us answers instead of letting us be people."

Eren nods once.

"That's why this ends with me," he says. "Not passed down. Not corrected by someone else. Just… ended."

Zeke looks at him, eyes unreadable.

"You really are different," he says. "Not because you're stronger. Because you stopped."

Eren watches the last ember fade.

"I just didn't want anyone else to inherit this."

Zeke straightens.

"For what it's worth," he says, voice steadier now, "I don't think you betrayed him."

Eren doesn't respond.

Zeke turns to leave, then stops once more.

"I hope," he says quietly, "that somewhere in all those memories… he finally learned how to be a father."

Eren closes his eyes.

"I think he did."

Zeke walks away.

Eren remains by the dying fire, alone, but lighter than before.

#### After a couple of days

When it is over, there is no celebration.

Only exhaustion.

Eren and Mikasa leave the Survey Corps the same way they lived in it, without announcement.

No ceremony.

No applause.

Just two cloaks folded neatly and placed where they belong.

They walk away together, not because the war is over, but because **their battle is finished**.

Armin stands before his first briefing as a section commander, notes clutched too tightly in his hands. Hange watches from the side, saying nothing.

When Armin speaks, his voice shakes once, then steadies.

People listen.

Not because of his title.

Because they trust him.

Levi train recruits in silence.

He doesn't talk about Titans.

He doesn't talk about glory.

He teaches them how to move.

How to watch each other's backs.

How to survive a world that no longer needs monsters.

Jean, Connie, and Sasha help.

Sometimes they laugh.

Sometimes they don't.

#### Marley

Annie doesn't expect him to be there.

The port is crowded, ships unloading supplies, people moving cautiously, still unsure how peace is supposed to look. She walks slowly, hands in her pockets, eyes scanning faces without really looking.

Then she stops.

He stands near the edge of the dock, thinner than she remembers, shoulders hunched, hands folded like he doesn't know where to put them. His hair is more gray now. His eyes search every passing figure, afraid of hoping too much.

"Dad…"

The word slips out before she realizes it.

He turns.

For a second, he just stares at her.

Then his breath catches.

"Annie?" His voice cracks immediately, like it's been waiting years to do that.

She nods once. That's all she manages.

He walks toward her, slow at first, like he's afraid she might vanish if he moves too fast. When he reaches her, he stops again, hands hovering uncertainly.

"You're… you're real," he says. "I didn't-after everything, I didn't know if-"

Annie steps forward and wraps her arms around him.

He stiffens for half a heartbeat, then breaks.

He pulls her close, arms shaking as he presses his face into her hair, holding on like the ground might disappear if he lets go.

"I'm sorry," he says, over and over. "I'm sorry I let them take you. I'm sorry I made you believe that was all you were worth."

Annie closes her eyes.

"I came back," she says quietly. "I promised I would."

He pulls back just enough to look at her face, cupping it with both hands as if memorizing it all over again.

"You kept your promise," he whispers. "I didn't think anyone could survive that."

She looks away. "Neither did I."

He shakes his head, tears spilling freely now. "You don't have to be strong anymore. You don't have to fight."

Annie swallows.

"I don't know how to stop," she admits.

He pulls her into another embrace, gentler this time.

"Then don't," he says softly. "Just… stay. We'll figure the rest out."

She nods against his shoulder.

For the first time since she was a child, Annie allows herself to be held without bracing for impact.

Around them, the world keeps moving, ships unloading, people talking, a future trying to begin.

But for Annie Leonhart, the war ends there.

In her father's arms.

Meanwhile, statues are pulled down.

Not smashed in rage, but dismantled carefully, piece by piece. The likenesses of false heroes are removed from plazas and melted down for scrap.

The Tybur estate is sealed.

Records are unsealed.

The lies spill out slowly, then all at once.

People don't riot.

They sit in stunned silence.

And then they begin asking questions that were never allowed before.

The internment zones open.

No one knows what to do at first.

Some Eldians don't leave.

Some do, and stand in the streets unsure where to go.

For the first time, there is no order forcing them either way.

Children are pulled from training programs.

Uniforms meant for teenagers are burned.

A generation is told, awkwardly, uncertainly that they are allowed to live.

#### Reiner's bedroom

Reiner wakes up choking on air.

His body jerks upright before his mind catches up, heart hammering so hard it hurts. The room feels too small, the ceiling too close. His hands claw at the sheets, searching for weight, for armor, for something that isn't there.

Walls.

Fire.

Screams.

For a moment, he's sixteen again.

Then he breathes.

Once.

Twice.

He presses his feet into the floor, feeling the wood beneath them. Not stone. Not rubble.

The room is quiet.

No alarms.

No orders.

Just the morning light slipping through the curtains.

Reiner sits there for a long time, letting the present settle around him. Letting the shaking pass. When it finally does, he wipes his face with the heel of his hand and stands.

Later that day, the smell of food reaches him from the next room.

Dinner.

His mother sits at the table when he enters, setting down bowls with careful movements. Gabi is already there, talking animatedly, hands moving faster than her words. Falco listens, nodding, occasionally interrupting to correct her.

Reiner hesitates in the doorway.

"Sit," his mother says gently, as if afraid to startle him.

He does.

For a few minutes, they eat in silence, the kind that isn't uncomfortable, just cautious.

Then Gabi can't hold it in anymore.

"They're shutting it all down," she says, eyes bright. "The Warrior program. All of it."

Reiner looks up.

"They said there's no more training," she continues. "No candidates. No inheriting anything. They're talking about enrolling us in regular schools."

Falco glances at Reiner. "Actual schools. With normal classes."

Reiner blinks. "Schools?"

Gabi nods hard. "Yeah. History, math, all that stuff. Not tactics. Not survival."

She pauses, then adds, softer, "No more kids getting sent away."

The words sit heavy on the table.

His mother brings a hand to her mouth, eyes shining. "They really said that?"

"They did," Gabi says. "They said we get to choose what we want to be."

Reiner stares at his bowl.

For years, he was told choice was a weakness. That obedience was purpose.

He exhales slowly.

Falco smiles, tentative. "I think I want to learn how planes work."

Gabi scoffs. "Of course you do."

Reiner lets out a sound before he realizes it.

A laugh.

It's quiet. Rough around the edges. But it's real.

Everyone freezes.

Reiner covers his mouth, surprised, then lowers his hand.

"I'm sorry," he says, voice unsteady. "I just…"

He doesn't finish.

He doesn't need to.

His mother reaches across the table and takes his hand.

For the first time in longer than he can remember, Reiner feels it.

Not the weight lifting all at once.

But the ground holding.

And when he smiles, really smiles, it's not because the past is gone.

It's because the future finally belongs to someone else.

Later after dinner Reiner, Annie, Zeke, and Pieck reunite the same place they promise to return once the war is over. Zeke invites Colt. They all have a bottle of beer and sit on the ground of Marleyan training ground. They keep two bottles on the side, remembering the friends they lost and couldn't make it up here to enjoy this moment.

#### Back to Paradis

Historia stands before representatives from nations that once feared her existence.

She does not speak of bloodlines.

She speaks of trade.

Of rebuilding.

Of shared responsibility.

For the first time, no one asks her to prove her right to rule.

The age of Titans does not end with fire or thunder.

It ends quietly.

With empty training grounds.

With unused serums.

With questions that no longer have terrifying answers.

The world does not become perfect.

But it becomes **possible**.

### **Three Years and Two Months Later**

The world grows quieter.

Not suddenly.

Not cleanly.

But steadily.

Marley does not rebuild itself through declarations or monuments. It does so through paperwork, through long hearings held in rooms that were once sealed off from public eyes. Former officials stand before crowds without uniforms, without titles, answering questions they were never meant to hear.

Some apologize.

Some refuse to.

All are recorded.

Borders do not vanish, but they loosen. Trade routes reopen where armies once marched. Formerly occupied nations send delegates instead of demands. Reparations are argued over, adjusted, argued over again.

Progress is slow.

But it is real.

#### New Military ground

Annie stands at attention on a training field.

Not as a weapon.

As an officer.

Her uniform is simple. No Titan insignia. No inherited curse. Just rank earned through skill, discipline, and experience.

She leads drills, efficient, precise, and controlled. Not teaching destruction, but restraint. Not how to overpower, but how to protect it.

Her father watches from the sidelines.

For years, he only knew her through fear.

Now he watches her choose this life freely.

When the recruits are dismissed, Annie looks over.

He's smiling.

She smiles back.

For the first time, she feels proud without bracing for consequences.

In a small classroom across the city, Reiner writes on a board.

**History.**

Not propaganda.

Not justification.

History as it happened.

He teaches children who have never have to take the burden of the world. Who have never been told their blood is a sin. Gabi sits near the front, listening intently, asking too many questions. Falco sits beside her, thoughtful, careful with his words.

Reiner tells them about nations rising and falling. About fear turning into policy. About how people are convinced to become weapons.

He does not paint himself as a hero.

He does not erase his role.

When a student asks him why wars keep happening, Reiner pauses.

"Because people forget that history is made so people can learn from the mistakes for our ancestors.," he says. "And that means we can learn from it to make our world a better place."

Gabi glances at Falco.

For the first time, the future feels like something they're allowed to imagine.

On another field, Porco and Pieck observe a group of soldiers running drills.

No Titans.

No serums.

No inheritance.

Just coordination, awareness, retreat.

Porco corrects a stance. Pieck adjusts a formation. They work in practiced rhythm, arguing quietly, refining constantly.

"Too aggressive," Pieck notes.

"Better than freezing," Porco replies.

She hums. "Balance, then."

They train soldiers to survive first, fight second.

Neither of them needs to prove anything anymore.

Zeke spends his days in administrative buildings, not war rooms.

He works with Colt, who takes the role more naturally than he expected. Together they oversee the dismantling of what remains of Marley's old military doctrine, closing Titan research facilities, decommissioning training camps, redirecting resources toward civil infrastructure.

There are arguments.

There is resistance.

But there are no children standing in line anymore.

That alone is enough to keep going.

The old terms begin to lose meaning.

"Eldian."

"Marleyan."

They still exist, written in records, spoken by older generations.

But children use them less.

They argue about school, about work, about whose turn it is to clean up, not about bloodlines they were never taught to fear.

The statue of Helos is taken down.

Not in anger.

In silence.

Its pieces are cataloged, melted, repurposed into materials for public works, bridges, railings, memorial plaques bearing no names of heroes.

In its place, a new statue is erected.

Eren Yeager does not stand triumphant.

He is not shown as a conqueror.

The sculptor depicts him mid-step, cloak caught by the wind, eyes fixed forward not above.

The plaque beneath it does not call him a god.

It reads simply:

_He chose an end._

People stop there often.

Some bow.

Some argue.

Some say nothing at all.

But no one forgets why the world looks different now.

Later that day, all of them meet at the port, as they all leave for Paradis to meet his friend one last time.

#### World Beyond Marley

The world does not change all at once.

In some places, the first signs are subtle.

Ports once reserved for Marleyan warships reopen to civilian trade. Flags are lowered quietly, replaced by nothing at all. Checkpoints remain but soldiers there ask for papers instead of obedience.

Formerly occupied nations argue among themselves about what independence should look like.

Some argue for unity.

Some for retribution.

Most simply want stability.

In cities once stripped of resources, factories are reopened under local control.

Workers argue over wages instead of rations. Children attend schools that teach geography without red lines drawn around "enemy" states. Histories are rewritten not to glorify suffering, but to acknowledge it.

The word _liberation_ is used carefully.

People have learned what happens when it's shouted too loudly.

In coastal nations, shipyards hum again.

Old Marleyan cannons are dismantled and melted down into tools, rails, anchors. Some are kept intact-not as weapons, but as reminders.

Museums open their doors with exhibits titled simply:

**What We Were Told**

**What We Lived**

**What We Choose Now**

**\----**

Visitors walk through slowly.

Some leave angry.

Some leave quiet.

Some bring their children back a second time.

\----

Not every place heals peacefully.

There are riots where collaborators are dragged into streets. There are trials that end without answers. There are leaders who replace Marley's banners with their own ambitions.

Freedom, it turns out, requires practice.

But something crucial is different now.

No foreign Titan casts a shadow over the debate.

In border regions once defined by fear, mixed communities begin to form.

Languages overlap. Customs clash. Marriages are questioned and then accepted. The words _Eldian_ and _Marleyan_ still exist, but they lose their sharpest edges.

Children argue over whose turn it is to speak, not whose blood is dangerous.

Delegations gather in neutral halls.

No one sits at the head of the table.

Agreements are messy. Temporary. Revised constantly.

But they are signed by choice.

Not by threat.

Stories begin to circulate.

Of an island that could have destroyed the world but didn't.

Of a man who chose an ending instead of a reign.

The stories differ depending on who tells them.

Some call him a hero.

Some call him a warning.

Most simply say:

"He stopped it."

The world does not become peaceful.

But it becomes **possible**.

And for the first time in generations, nations argue about futures instead of survival.

#### Paradis Island

In Paradis, old Levi Squad (minus Eren and Mikasa) along with Queen Historia waits for the arrival of their guests overseas.

The walls don't exist anymore.

It becomes small.

Not weak, _human_.

People no longer live stacked by class or distance from danger. The old divisions fade quietly: inner districts lose their privilege, outer districts lose their stigma. Homes are rebuilt where people choose to stay, not where walls once forced them.

Those with land and resources invest outward. Workshops open. Farms expand. Employment replaces rationing.

Wealth becomes circulation, not protection.

Trade ships dock at newly built ports.

Rail lines stretch inland, carrying goods from abroad, machines, books, blueprints written in languages Paradis once feared. Technologies are adapted, not imported blindly. Engineers argue over power systems. Builders debate materials. Nothing is rushed.

Progress is careful.

Intentional.

Beyond the city, a vast open yard stretches across reclaimed land.

The Colossal Titans stand there, over 600-700 thousands of them, reduced now to forms closer to ordinary Titans. Their massive frames no longer strain the earth. Their heat no longer scorches the air.

They are dormant.

Not imprisoned.

Not revered.

Simply… waiting.

Researchers monitor them from a distance, documenting changes in physiology. The Titans no longer feel like weapons.

They feel like a question slowly fading.

Nearby, Connie's mother laying quietly in the sun.

The military still exists.

But it is no longer divided.

There are no factions competing for relevance. No children taught that survival is their destiny.

Instead, service evolves.

Some train as **coastal guardians**, ensuring safe trade and navigation.

Some become **disaster response units**, deploying to floods, quakes, fires.

Others serve as **escorts and envoys**, protecting travelers and scholars abroad.

Strength is no longer measured by how many enemies you can kill-

-but by how many people you can bring home.

Shadis oversees training with the same severity as before.

The difference is what he trains them for.

"Protect," he tells them. "Don't dominate."

They listen.

New professions emerge.

Aviation engineers design gliders, then planes, machines meant to observe, not bomb. Marine explorationists chart deep waters once thought unreachable. Expeditionary scholars travel beyond the island, documenting snowfields, jungles, deserts, volcanoes, returning with maps, journals, stories.

Not conquest.

Curiosity.

People volunteer for these journeys not because they are ordered-

-but because they _want to know_.

Children go to school.

Real schools.

They learn geography that extends beyond the island. They study cultures, languages, histories that contradict one another. Teachers encourage questions instead of silence.

Maps hang on classroom walls.

Not blank.

Not forbidden.

Armin visits once, standing at the back of a room as a teacher explains climates he once only dreamed about.

The children already know more than he did at their age.

He smiles anyway.

Paradis does not become perfect.

Arguments still happen. Mistakes are still made. Fear still exists, sometimes.

But it no longer defines everything.

The island is no longer a cage.

It is a place.

And for the first time since its founding, Paradis is not preparing for the end of the world,

It is preparing to be part of it.

The house sits where the forest thins, far enough from the road that the wind reaches it first.

Smoke curls lazily from the chimney.

Bootsteps stop at the door.

Mikasa opens it before anyone knocks.

She smiles when she sees them.

"You made it."

Behind her, two small figures peek out from the doorway.

Thomas grips Faye's sleeve. Faye peers around him, eyes wide and curious.

"Uncle Zeke?" Thomas asks uncertainly.

Zeke's face breaks into a grin so sudden it almost startles him.

"That's me," he says, crouching instinctively. "You must be the troublemakers."

Faye giggles. Thomas straightens proudly.

"We're not trouble," he says. "Mama says we're explorers."

Zeke laughs softly. "I like that better."

Behind him, the grandparents step forward slowly, older now, careful with their steps, eyes already wet, smiling at the kids.

They enter together.

The house is warm. Simple. Lived in.

And quiet.

Too quiet.

They find him in the back room, sunlight filtering through thin curtains.

Eren lies in bed, thinner than they remember, skin pale, chest rising slowly. For a moment, no one is sure if he's awake.

Then his eyes open.

They focus.

One face at a time.

Armin.

Jean.

Connie.

Sasha.

Levi.

Hange.

Historia.

Reiner.

Annie.

Pieck.

Porco.

Zeke.

And finally,

His grandparents.

His lips curve into the faintest smile.

"…You all came," he murmurs.

"Like we'd miss it," Jean says quietly.

Levi folds his arms. "Tch. You've always been bad at timing."

Eren exhales a soft, breathless laugh.

Mikasa steps closer, gently placing Thomas and Faye near the bed.

"Papa," Faye whispers.

Eren's eyes soften instantly.

"There you are," he says. "I was wondering when you'd show up."

Thomas climbs closer, careful, as if the bed might break.

"You're really tired," he says.

"Yeah," Eren answers honestly. "But it's the good kind."

His grandmother takes his hand. It's warm but fragile.

"You did enough," she says. "More than enough."

Eren looks at her, then at his grandfather.

"I'm sorry," he says quietly. "For worrying you."

His grandfather shakes his head. "We worried because we loved you. That never changes."

Silence settles, not heavy, just full.

Zeke steps forward last.

He doesn't say anything at first.

Eren meets his eyes.

"Hey," Eren says softly.

Zeke swallows. "Hey."

They hold each other's gaze for a long moment.

"…You did good," Zeke says.

Eren nods. "So did you."

That's all they need.

Eren's breathing slows.

He looks around the room one final time.

"I don't really have anything important to say," he admits. "I think… I already said it all."

He glances at Mikasa.

She takes his hand, steady despite the tears slipping down her face.

"Thank you," Eren says. "For coming. For staying."

His eyes drift closed.

His chest rises once more,

Then slowly, gently, his body begins to dissolve.

Not violently.

Not painfully.

Like ash carried away by the light.

No one moves.

No one speaks.

### **The Ethereal Plane**

Meanwhile, Eren opens his eyes.

He is not alone.

Faces he thought lost forever wait for him, friends, family, even enemies at peace. And in front of them all,

He look at his parents.

He breaks.

He runs.

His mother holds him tight. "I'm proud of you," she says.

His father rests his hand on Eren's head. "Welcome home."

Eren looks at Ymir. "Thank you."

She shakes her head, smiling through tears. "No. Thank _you_. You freed us."

The souls gather.

They kneel, not in worship, but in respect.

Eren doesn't understand.

"Why…?" His voice is small. "I didn't do this alone."

A man steps forward from the crowd.

Short hair. Sharp eyes. A presence that feels familiar in a way Eren can't place at first.

"You didn't," the man says. "But you finished it."

Eren stares. "…You are,"

"I carried the Attack Titan once," the man replies calmly. "Like many of us here."

Another figure joins him, older, hardened, wearing the weight of a forgotten war in his posture.

"We were the ones who first noticed it," the second man says. "During the Great Titan War. When the Founder's command reached us… and failed."

Eren's brow furrows. "Failed?"

"Yes," the first man says. "We didn't understand why. Only that something had changed."

He looks at Eren with quite certainty.

"When you touched her," he says, nodding toward Ymir, "your will rippled outward. Not as an order. Not as a command."

"As a release."

Eren's chest tightens.

"The moment the cycle finally cracked," the man continues, "echoed across us all. Across every bearer who had ever refused to kneel."

Eren remembers it then.

Not clearly.

Just the feeling.

The pull.

The presence of others he never knew.

"I didn't mean to," Eren says softly.

"No," the second man agrees. "You didn't."

He places a hand over his heart.

"That's why it mattered," he says. "Something reached us. Not words. Not commands."

He looks at Eren steadily.

"But the feeling that we didn't have to accept the fate the world decided for us."

The man exhales, almost smiling.

"It gave us the strength to resist. Even when we didn't know why. Even when it made no sense."

One by one, the past bearers step closer. Warriors without monuments. Rebels without names. Men and women history never recorded.

They bow.

Not because Eren commanded it.

Because they recognize what he chose.

The rest follow.

Friends. Family. Even former enemies.

All standing together.

Ymir watches them, free at last.

And for the first time since the world began tearing itself apart,

There is no future to fear.

No past left unresolved.

Only rest.

Inside Eren's home, his body is completely disintegrated to smoke.

Mikasa keeps holding his hand until there's nothing left to hold.

Outside, the forest stirs.

The world continues.

And somewhere beyond the room, a long war finally lets go.

As the last connection to the living world fades, the tree of light in the Ethereal Plane dissolves into nothing; the souls disappear.

No paths remain.

No cycles continue.

Only emptiness, like everything ceased from existence.

## END CREDITS

- Connie meets his mother again after Erens death.
- All the colossal titans turn back into humans, who are completely in shock as they are from a different era. Historia accepts them and promises to accept them.
- Porco and Pieck leave for Marley while others decide to stay; as they are here also to lend their hands to the islanders; to help people who turned back from Titans to rehabilitate and adapt in this era.
- Zeke and his grandparents accept the responsibility to take care of the kids, as Mikasa decides to get back into the field to help people and won't have enough time to look out for the kids. For now, they stay on the island to assist a little with rehabilitation.
- More nations are involved in assisting the islanders with rehabilitation.

### REHABILITATION

#### Early Months - Survival & Disorientation

- The first months are chaos. Endless temporary shelters stretch across open land. Medics move constantly. People wake confused, frightened, speaking languages long forgotten. Some collapse under the weight of time itself.
- Paradis does not turn them away. Despite shortages and fear, Historia orders the gates to remain open. "They were promised a place to live as people," she says. "We won't abandon them now."
- Joint medical teams form. Paradis doctors, Marleyan physicians, and foreign volunteers work side by side. Survival comes before understanding. Hunger is fought before history.

#### Stabilization - Understanding Before Integration

- Confusion is more dangerous than hunger. Groups gather daily as translators and historians begin explaining the world. Dates are repeated. Maps are redrawn again and again.
- Armin spends hours answering questions that never end. Annie stays beside him. When he speaks only of the present, she adds what Marley once taught and what it hid. Together, they learn how to tell the truth. After their lectures, Armin and Annie get to spend more time together, talking about their stuff.

#### Expansion - Making Space for the Living

- The island grows outward. Old restricted zones are reclaimed. Roads are laid where Titans once stood. Paradis becomes large again, not by conquest, but by necessity.
- New agricultural lands are carved from unused plains. Irrigation channels stretch across open fields. Former Titans work beside the islanders. Hunger does not disappear but it retreats.
- The strain deepens. Food lines grow longer. Exhaustion spreads. Advisors urge limits. Historia refuses. "Then we save as many as we can," she says, "and carry the weight."

#### Shared Responsibility - Truth, Labor, and Repair

- Aid arrives unevenly. Supply ships dock. Engineers expand water systems. Some nations help. Some hesitate. Enough choose responsibility.
- Reiner sits among the displaced. Not as a leader, not as a soldier. He draws borders in the dirt, explains wars without pride, lies without defense. He teaches history as something done to them, not something they deserved.
- Marleyan doctors work beside Paradis medics. Former Warriors act as liaisons, translating not just language but accountability.
- Annie begins patrolling settlements at night. Teaching self-defense, not war. Sitting with those who cannot sleep.
- Jean oversees training for volunteers. No shouting. No glory. Just preparation to serve the island, not defend it from monsters.
- Historia doesn't go to her office; she works along with the people in the field. As she gets completely exhausted and decides to have dinner, Reiner arrives with food and drinks for two. No explanation. No apology. Historia nods. They sit. They talk about land, people, tomorrow.

#### One Year - From Camps to Community

- Tents give way to permanent homes. Camps become towns. Schools form where ages mix strangely. Children learn a world larger than the one Armin once imagined.
- Connie laughs again. He teaches children drills as games. His mother watches nearby, human and alive.
- Sasha hunts and teaches food preservation. Feeding people becomes as important as protecting them.

#### Transition - Choice Returns

- Some returnees choose to leave. Repatriation routes open. Ships depart. Others choose to stay. For the first time in centuries, choice feels normal.
- Zeke and the grandparents return to Marley. He also takes the kids with him, to raise them with grandparents in Marley as Mikasa continues her duty. Zeke in a way is fulfilling the promise given to Eren; that is to show kids the world outside. Mikasa promises the kids that she will come to visit them, also she asks them to come visit Paradis occasionally. He does.

#### Two Years - Stability Without Triumph

- Rehabilitation is no longer the island's only purpose. Cooperation replaces the crisis. Fields sustain the population. Numbers stop mattering.
- Late one night, Historia finishes reviewing reports for long past exhaustion. She prepares to eat alone. A knock comes.
- Reiner arrives with food and drinks for two. Historia nods.

#### Closing Beat

- Levi watches the island from a distance. Not as its strongest soldier but as someone no longer needed to be, also imagining if Erwin could see the result of his gambling.
- They did not build paradise. They built a place where no one was abandoned again.
