# CHAPTER 1: THE ORDINARY DAYS
The late afternoon sun dipped behind the brick walls of Brooklyn Visions Academy, washing the campus in gold. Students spilled out of the gates, laughing, chatting, and scrolling through their phones. Miles Morales walked among them with his headphones on, music pulsing like a private soundtrack to his life. Every now and then he lifted a hand to wave at familiar faces — classmates, neighbors, the shop owner across the street who always saved him a bag of plantain chips.

To anyone watching, he looked like any other seventeen-year-old heading home after a long day. But inside, Miles carried the quiet weight of memories no one else could see.

His apartment smelled faintly of sofrito when he pushed the door open.

“Mijo,” his mother greeted warmly, her tired face softening into a smile as she wrapped him in a quick hug. Rio Morales had learned to hold on just long enough to reassure herself he was really there, but not long enough to smother him.

Miles dropped his bag, took a quick shower, and sat down for lunch. The routine steadied him — the kind of rhythm his father had always believed in. Eat well. Stay sharp. Do right by people.

Not long after, his skateboard rattled beneath him as he coasted down the familiar streets, heading toward <a name="_int_yhkwrxdi"></a>Oscorp’s outreach center.

The facility didn’t look like a typical charity — not with Oscorp’s logo gleaming on its glass walls — but inside, hope breathed through the place. It wasn’t about free meals or clothing drives; this was cutting-edge medical care, genetic treatments designed to save people who had been told they were out of options.

At the front, Miles spotted Flint Marko, the man who somehow balanced his rough, working-class edges with the steady patience of someone who had seen too much. Flint had taken charge of the program, making sure no one was left waiting or unheard.

“Miles, my man,” Flint said with a weathered smile, extending his hand for a shake.

“Hey, Mr. Marko,” Miles grinned, gripping it firmly. “How’s everything going?”

“Running smooth. Only thing missing is Parker. Haven’t seen him in about a month now. Guess he’s tied up with… something.” Flint’s voice trailed with a shrug, though the shadow in his eyes suggested more than casual absence.

Miles nodded, trying not to dwell on it. Peter Parker was many things — Oscorp’s benefactor, the quiet force behind this center. But lately, Peter has been seemed to have vanished.

Miles slipped into his volunteer gear, ready to start work. As he adjusted his gloves, the TV on the wall flickered with a news anchor’s crisp voice.

“Still no sightings of Spider-Man. Questions continue to rise about the city’s missing hero…”

Miles’ chest tightened. What could keep Spider-Man away from the city this long?

His thoughts broke when a familiar voice cut in, smooth with sarcasm.

“Don’t you have work to do?”

He turned, surprised, to see Gwen Stacy standing near the doorway. Her white lab coat hung neatly at her sides, but her presence carried authority beyond her years. Since Peter had stepped back, Gwen had become Oscorp’s acting CEO, balancing boardroom politics with late-night experiments.

“Gwen!” Miles straightened, unable to hide his grin. “I was just… watching the news.”

She raised an eyebrow, half-smiling. “Sure you were.” Then, softening, she asked, “How are you? And your mom?”

Miles shifted, his tone more earnest. “We’re good. Tough sometimes, y’know, after what happened to my dad… but we’re okay. Mr. Parker, you, and Oscorp — you’ve all helped a lot.”

Her expression gentled. “It’s the least we can do. Don’t carry that weight alone, Miles.” She glanced at the patients being treated, then back at him. “Anyway, don’t let me distract you. Keep up the good work.”

“Thanks, Ms. Stacy. You too.”

With a polite nod, Gwen turned and disappeared down the hallway. Miles lingered on the moment before pushing himself back into routine.

Later that evening, after his shift at a nearby café, Miles returned home. The night had cooled the city, and the glow of streetlamps followed him like watchful eyes. Inside, he and Rio shared dinner, the small apartment filled with the comforting clatter of plates.

As they cleaned up, Rio asked gently, “So, how was your day?”

Miles leaned against the counter, telling her everything — about Flint, Gwen, the patients, even his small worries about Spider-Man’s absence. But more than that, he spoke about the kind of man he wanted to become: strong like his father, wise like Mr. Parker, and dependable enough that people could count on him.

Rio listened, pride softening her tired features. “Your father would be proud,” she whispered. “And so am I.”

Later, when Miles finally lay in bed, the city hummed outside his window — cars, voices, distant sirens. His eyes closed slowly, thoughts drifting between the life he had, the people he admired, and the questions that lingered like shadows.

Somewhere in that space between dreams and silence, the world seemed to wait for him.



# CHAPTER 2: THE BREAKING POINT
Two days later, the outreach center hummed with its usual rhythm. Doctors shuffled between patients, nurses whispered encouragement, and the low thrum of medical machines blended into a strangely comforting background. Miles was at his station, restocking supplies, when Flint Marko sat down nearby, turning a small silver locket over in his massive hands.

Inside, a picture of a smiling little girl.

“She’s doing well,” Flint said softly, almost to himself. “Her mom too. They’re safe, that’s all that matters.”

Miles leaned on the counter, glancing at the locket. “She’s lucky to have you. You ever tell her how much you’ve done for people here?”

Flint smiled faintly, but before he could answer, a sound like thunder cracked through the air outside — followed by screams.

The building trembled. Windows rattled. Something enormous was moving through the streets.

Both Flint and Miles rushed to the entrance, along with everyone else, and froze.

Charging down the avenue, tossing cars aside like toys, was a monster in steel-plated armor — the Rhino. His horn tore through asphalt, his massive frame scattering civilians in panic.

Flint’s jaw tightened. “I know where he’s headed.” He turned to Miles, urgent now. “Come on. First we get these people inside — doctors, patients, everyone. Then we move.”

Miles nodded, adrenaline spiking. Together, they herded patients and staff deeper into the building, away from the glass walls that shuddered with every impact outside.

But the chaos didn’t stop there. From above, a shadow dropped from the rooftop — a man in segmented green armor, his tail whipping like a blade.

Scorpion.

He landed in front of Rhino, shouting:

“What the hell are you doing? You’re supposed to hit Oscorp, not level the whole city!”

From high above, a voice answered smoothly. “It’s fine.”

Both Scorpion and Rhino looked up as enormous wings cut through the air. Vulture descended, talons digging into the pavement, carrying their leader on his shoulders.

Kraven the Hunter landed with feline grace, his eyes sharp beneath the mane of his lion-skin vest.

“There’s our target,” Kraven said, scanning Oscorp Tower. “We move now.”

Rhino growled. “Where’s the Lizard?”

“Close.” Kraven raised his wrist, activating a sleek device strapped to it. A pulse of energy rippled outward.

From the shadows, Lizard leapt down, but something was wrong — his movements stiff, unnatural. Around his neck glowed a metallic collar, a chip at its base fused into his scales. Kraven’s thumb brushed the device on his wrist, and the creature stilled, awaiting orders.

Miles’ eyes widened. “He’s controlling him…”

Flint grabbed his arm. “No time. We get to Oscorp. Now.”

Inside the tower, alarms blared as Flint called Gwen. His voice was rough but steady. “I’ve got Miles with me. We’re headed your way.”

“I’ll meet you at the elevator,” Gwen replied, her voice sharp with urgency. “Hurry.”

They reached the ground floor just as the massive form of Rhino lowered his head, ready to ram through the entrance.

Flint’s eyes darted to a construction site next door. Sand. He clenched his fists.

“No choice…”

In an instant, his hands dissolved into swirling grains, sweeping outward in a storm. A massive wall of sand erupted, slamming against the glass doors and holding back Rhino’s charge.

Miles froze. “Mr. Marko… what—what are you?”

“Later, kid!” Flint shouted, straining as his sand-body pressed harder against Rhino’s bulk.

The elevator dinged open. People spilled out, escaping through emergency exits as Gwen waved them through. She turned to Miles. “Get in.”

He hesitated, staring at Flint’s shifting, sand-carved form.

“Miles, now!” Gwen snapped.

With one last glance, Miles stepped inside. Gwen followed, quickly entering a secret override code. The panel beeped, and instead of heading up, the elevator sank — deeper and deeper below the building.

Miles gripped the rail, confusion boiling over. “Okay, someone explain! Flint has powers? Oscorp is under attack? And what’s with this secret floor?”

Gwen exhaled, steady but tense. “Calm down. Peter and I anticipated something like this. We built a fallback… a lair. Connected to Oscorp. A place no one can touch.”

Miles blinked. “Why? What does that have to do with Peter?”

Her eyes softened, though her words stayed firm. “Everything, Miles. You’ll see.”

Meanwhile, at the base of Oscorp Tower, Kraven handed out sleek communicators to his team.

“You three — secure the building. No one gets in or out. The Lizard and I have other matters.”

Scorpion clicked his jaw. “Fine.”

Kraven tried the elevator, but the system rejected his command. His lips curved into a predatory grin. He slipped a high-tech helmet over his head and turned to Vulture.

“Take me up.”

With a screech of metal wings, they rose into the air.

*Underground Lair*

Far below, the secret elevator came to a halt. The doors opened to a cavernous underground chamber, dimly lit but alive with hidden technology.

Miles stepped out, his eyes wide. “This… this is real?”

At the entrance, a figure leaned casually against the wall, arms crossed. Felicia Hardy.

“Took you long enough,” she said dryly.

Miles’ head spun. “Felicia? You work here too?”

Before he could process it further, movement drew his gaze.

A man sat at the far end of the chamber, bandages wrapped across his torso, scars crisscrossing his skin. His eyes lifted, tired but kind, locking with Miles’.

“Hey, Miles,” Peter Parker said quietly.

The boy’s breath caught. His gaze flicked to the glass case nearby — where a torn, battle-worn Spider-Man suit hung suspended, its colors dulled by time and blood.

The truth hit him like a tidal wave.

It wasn’t just a suit. It was a life. A legacy.

And Peter had carried it alone.

The glass reflected Miles’ stunned face as the world around him shifted forever.

(Camera lingers on the suit.)


# CHAPTER 3: SHADOWS OF THE PAST

*Oscorp Tower*

The fluorescent lights flickered on the thirteenth floor. Kraven’s boots echoed against the tile as he pushed open a reinforced lab door. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and metal.

From the corner of the room, a guttural voice rasped.

“You will fail… bastard.”

Kraven turned. The Lizard strained against his own body, claws trembling as if resisting an invisible leash. His reptilian eyes burned with a flicker of humanity.

Kraven tilted his head, almost amused. “Still stubborn. Still fighting. Admirable.”

He tapped the device strapped to his wrist.

The collar around Lizard’s neck flared with energy, seizing his muscles in place. His growl choked off, twisted into obedience.

“Enough memories,” Kraven muttered. “Time to be useful.”

*The Secret Lair*

Far beneath Oscorp, the atmosphere was tense but steady. Miles clutched the phone tightly, speaking quickly into it.

“Mom? Are you okay?”

Rio’s voice crackled through, gentle but concerned. “I’m fine, Miles. Where are you?”

“I’m with Mr. Marko and Ms. Stacy. I’ll be safe with them. I… I have to go now.”

A pause. Then her voice softened. “Take care of yourself, mijo.”

Miles swallowed hard. “I will, Mom. Bye.”

He ended the call, handing the phone back to Peter, who sat propped against the medical bed, scars visible across his torso.

“Thanks, Mr. Parker,” Miles murmured.

Peter shook his head. “Don’t worry. Once Gwen and Felicia finish their work, we’ll stop them.”

But Miles’ voice cracked, torn between awe and disbelief. “It’s just… so much. All of it. If you don’t mind… would you tell me what happened? How you ended up like this?”

Peter’s eyes flicked to Flint. The sandman gave a small nod — let him in.

Peter sighed. “Alright. Since you’ve seen the suit… no point hiding. I’m Spider-Man. And this—” he gestured to his battered body, “—happened three weeks ago.”

*Three Weeks Ago — The Docks*

The night smelled of salt and rust. Spider-Man clung to the side of an abandoned warehouse, his mask lenses narrowing.

“Alright, Gwen,” he whispered into the comm. “I’m near the basement. Sending you scans.”

Her voice crackled back, steady as always. “Got it. I see Connors, but—”

The line went dead.

“Gwen? …Come on.”

He slipped inside.

The basement was dim, water dripping from rusted pipes. In the center sat Dr. Curt Connors, bound to a chair, unconscious.

“Doc?” Spidey whispered, crouching low. “Hey, it’s me. You’re safe now.”

But then — the tingle. His skin prickled, a warning screaming through every nerve.

He lunged, yanking Connors clear just as a wall exploded inward. A hulking figure in mechanized armor burst through, horn lowered. Rhino.

Spidey rolled, placing Connors against cover. “Big guy, you ever think about using the front door?”

Rhino roared, charging. The basement shook as their battle crashed from wall to wall, cement crumbling under every blow.

They fight for a moment until a voice cut through: “STOP!”

Scorpion stood in the shadows, tail coiled tight around Connors’ neck. His serrated stinger glinted inches from skin.

“Move again,” Scorpion hissed, “and I snap his spine.”

Spider-Man froze. His fists clenched, but his voice was calm. “Alright. Don’t hurt him. I’ll stand down.”

That was all Rhino needed. He swung his fists like wrecking balls, pounding Spider-Man again and again, until blood flecked the floor. With a final blow, he hurled him through the wall and into the night air.

Before Spidey could recover, talons seized him. Vulture swooped from above, dragging him into the sky before slamming him back down from a sickening height.

Spider-Man crawled forward, his breath ragged. Suddenly Scorpion stabbed Peter with his sting. Peter is in excruciating pain. And then, a shadow fell across him.

Kraven.

His team flanked him, predators circling wounded prey.

“At last,” Kraven said softly, almost reverently. “The bug is crushed.”

Spider-Man spat blood, forcing himself up. “If you hurt Connors—”

Kraven’s grin widened. “You mean… this?”

He raised his wrist device.

From the darkness, the Lizard landed hard on the floor. But his movements were stiff, his claws twitching against his will. The collar at his neck glowed faintly, wires embedded deep into flesh.

Spidey’s heart sank. “Doc…”

The Lizard snarled, voice guttural, broken. “H…help me…”

Kraven tapped the device. The Lizard snapped to heel, enslaved.

But before Kraven could finish him, the ground trembled.

A tidal wave of sand swept through the docks, swallowing everything in its path. Sandman. His colossal form surged like a storm, wrapping Kraven’s hunters in a suffocating vortex.

When the sand cleared, Spider-Man was gone.

Kraven roared in fury.

*The Secret Lair — Now*

Miles listened wide-eyed as Peter’s voice faded.

“If it wasn’t for Flint and Gwen,” Peter said quietly, “I’d be dead.”

Miles’ hands curled into fists. His eyes darted to Felicia. “So, this Black Cat who fed you that false tip — where is she now?”

Felicia stepped forward, her voice steady. “Right here.”

Miles’ breath caught. Anger surged. “You? Because of you, Mr. Parker nearly died!” His voice cracked into a shout. “Why would you do that to him?”

He lunged, but Flint caught his shoulders, pulling him back. “Easy, kid. Listen first.”

Felicia’s eyes hardened, but her tone carried regret. “I never meant to hurt Peter. I was done with that life. I used to work for Wilson Fisk — Kingpin. I stole, lied, did everything he asked. But after Kraven killed him, I erased that past. Started over. Peter gave me that chance.”

Gwen frowned. “You mean Fisk is dead?”

Felicia nodded. “Yes. But the night before Connors was taken, Kraven was waiting in my home. He threatened me — help him, or he’d expose me. I panicked. I told him Connors was the real prize, not Peter. And I helped him set the trap.”

Miles’ glare burned. “So you betrayed him.”

Felicia winced. “I didn’t know Peter was Spider-Man then. Kraven ordered me to lure Spider-Man to the docks. I did. But when I came here to Oscorp afterward, I overheard Gwen. She was talking to Peter on comms. That’s when I realized. And when I heard Spider-Man being beaten… I knew. I called Flint. We brought Peter back here. The rest… you know.”

Silence filled the room.

Peter finally spoke. “I always thought Fisk had gone underground. No body, no proof. And Kraven… he was just a ghost story until now.”

A sharp ping cut through the silence. Gwen hurried to the computer. Her eyes widened.

“The antidote’s ready,” she whispered. “If it works… it could cure the Lizard. Maybe the others too.”

Peter forced himself upright, wincing. “Then we make a plan. We hit Kraven hard, free Connors, and stop this before it spreads.”

He looked at Miles — the boy still processing the weight of it all.

“Together.”


# CHAPTER 4

The night sky above Manhattan was restless. Storm clouds swirled in silence, reflecting the pulse of Oscorp Tower’s cold steel frame. At its base, the Rhino prowled like a titan on guard, his heavy footsteps shaking the pavement as if daring anyone to approach.

From the shadows, Sandman emerged, his body shifting seamlessly between armor and grit. With every step, his resolve hardened — this wasn’t just a battle, it was redemption. He knew the plan, and there was no turning back.

Rhino caught sight of him. With a guttural roar, he thundered forward, lowering his head like a raging bull. But Sandman didn’t flinch. Instead, he poured his body forward, extending a tide of shifting sand that surged across the ground. At the last moment, he raised a dune beneath Rhino’s feet. The beast stumbled, crashing to the floor with an earthshaking thud.

Before Rhino could rise, Sandman hurled a canister at his face — the anti-serum. The gas hissed out in a sharp white cloud, searing into Rhino’s lungs. He coughed, roared, and clawed at the air as the monstrous armor of his mutation began to peel away, revealing the fragile man trapped inside.

Sandman pressed a hand to his comm, voice steady.

“First target neutralized. Moving to position two.”

Outside, Gwen’s heart pounded as she listened in from the surveillance van. She turned to Miles, who was already tugging nervously at the straps of his backpack.

“That’s our cue,” she said.

Together, they slipped from the van and darted toward Oscorp’s glass doors, their breaths sharp in the night. Gwen guided him with quiet urgency, her eyes flicking constantly toward the shadows as though danger might leap from any corner.

Meanwhile, several blocks away, Spider-Man crouched atop a lamppost, his mask turned toward the tower that loomed like a fortress. Black Cat stood beside him, the moonlight glinting off the synthetic gloves and mechanical web-shooters strapped to her wrists. She flexed her hands once, testing the tension, and gave Peter a crooked smile.

“Careful doesn’t suit me,” she teased softly.

“Just… stay alive,” Peter replied, his voice tight with the weight of everything at stake.

They leapt together, slicing through the wind, twin streaks of shadow and silver threading across the skyline. Their ascent up Oscorp’s walls was swift, silent, almost balletic — but the stillness shattered the moment they crested the rooftop.

Waiting for them, outlined against the harsh glow of floodlights, stood Kraven, Vulture, and Scorpion. Predators poised for the kill.

Peter’s instincts screamed.

“Run!” he barked.

Felicia didn’t hesitate. She sprinted across the rooftop and vaulted toward the open skyline. Vulture screeched, wings snapping wide, while Scorpion’s tail lashed out in fury. Kraven’s sharp command cut through the chaos, sending his pack to pursue her.

In seconds, the rooftop was silent again — just Spider-Man and Kraven, circling one another under the hum of the city.

Kraven drew his daggers with a predator’s grin.

“At last, the hunt narrows to hunter and prey.”

Spider-Man pulled his collapsible baton from his belt, the metal glinting faintly.

“Prey fights back,” he shot back, voice steady.

Their clash erupted in a storm of steel and speed. Kraven’s blades slashed with primal precision, every strike meant to kill. Spider-Man countered with whip-fast reflexes, his baton sparking as it deflected each attack. But Peter’s eyes weren’t just on the daggers — they were on the device strapped to Kraven’s wrist, the faint pulses connecting it to the collar clamped around Lizard’s neck.

It clicked. The signal patterns, the neural mimicry… it was too familiar. He had seen something like it before.

“No,” Peter muttered under his breath, even as he dodged another strike.

He opened his comm.

“Felicia — Octavius. Did Fisk ever deal with him?”

Her voice crackled through the earpiece, strained as she ran.

“Yes. Fisk recovered his body after the docks fire. Stripped him for tech. Why?”

Peter’s gut clenched.

“Because I see Kraven’s device, it’s like Otto’s neural interface technology. That chip — it’s controlling Connors.”

He fumbled a small EMP grenade from his belt, thumbed the trigger, and hurled it at Kraven’s wrist. The blast cracked like thunder, sparks dancing through the night. The device sputtered, died.

Across the tower, Lizard staggered as though waking from a nightmare, his eyes clearing for the first time in weeks. He clutched his head, growling in confusion.

“Gwen — now!” Peter shouted.

Inside Connors’ lab, Gwen and Miles froze as the hulking reptilian form loomed before them. For a heartbeat, fear rooted them to the floor. Then recognition flickered in Connors’ eyes.

“Gwen…” His voice was rough, guttural, but it was his. “Destroy… the collar.”

Gwen’s trembling hand reached for the EMP charge Miles held. With a sharp exhale, she pressed it to the collar’s power core. The device sparked, whined, and snapped apart, tumbling to the floor. The monstrous Lizard fell to one knee, breathing heavily, but his eyes — Curt’s eyes — were free.

Gwen moved quickly, mixing the prepared antidote, but Curt held up a clawed hand.

“Not yet. Peter still needs us.”

Meanwhile, far from the tower, Black Cat skidded to a halt on the beach. The sand stretched wide and empty before her, waves crashing under the moon. Vulture and Scorpion descended in a fury, thinking her cornered.

Felicia smirked and raised a hand in signal.

The ground beneath them erupted. Tendrils of sand coiled up like serpents, dragging the villains down by their legs, pinning them to the waist. Sandman rose behind them, his form towering and merciless.

“End of the line,” he growled.

Felicia tossed two canisters, shattering them at their feet. Smoke hissed around their bodies — the anti-serum. Within moments, Vulture’s wings faltered, Scorpion’s tail slackened, and both collapsed into their weakened human forms.

Sandman released them, their groans fading into the surf. Their part of the plan was complete.

Back on the rooftop, Kraven tore the sparking device from his arm. His breath came heavy, but his eyes gleamed with the wildfire of the hunt.

Spider-Man stood before him, baton steady, mask unreadable.

Two warriors. One storm.

THE END


# CHAPTER 5
Kraven’s right arm bled from the blast, but his grin never wavered. Across from him, Spider-Man stood battered, his chest heaving.

“It’s over,” Peter rasped. “You’ve lost.”

But Kraven only chuckled, a low growl that echoed through the rooftop. With a flick of his wrist, he hurled a smoke grenade at the ground. The plume swallowed the night, choking Spider-Man’s view in gray haze. By the time the smoke cleared, Kraven was gone.

Peter tensed. His senses prickled, then dulled — Kraven was toying with them. From the shadows, the hunter raised his blowgun, his eyes fixed on his prey. A feint in the air, a shift of sound — and Spider-Man misread it. He leapt, twisting to dodge an attack that wasn’t there.

The dart struck him mid-air. It grazed his shoulder, slicing his jacket before burying itself in the fabric. Pain lanced through his body, fire spreading under his skin as the toxin seeped into his blood. He yanked the jacket free, but the damage was done.

Peter landed hard, stumbling. By the time he looked up, Kraven had already vanished into the labyrinth of Oscorp’s corridors.

Through gritted teeth, Peter opened his comm.

“Gwen… get everyone out. Kraven’s in the building.”

In the lab, Gwen’s voice faltered.

“What about you?”

“I’ll finish this. Just go.”

But Lizard’s guttural growl interrupted.

“The building’s a trap. Too many exits rigged. I’ll take them down myself.”

Before Gwen could argue, Curt scooped her and Miles into his arms. With a single leap, he carried them out through a shattered window, clinging to the tower’s wall and crawling down into the night.

Peter, meanwhile, forced his trembling body forward, following Kraven’s trail with his thermal scanner. His head swam from the poison, his vision blurred at the edges, but the hunt wasn’t over.

The warehouse. Empty, silent, thick with shadows.

“Come out, Kraven!” Peter’s voice cracked against the rafters. “It ends tonight!”

He hurled the poisoned dart back into the dark. A figure shifted. His webs snapped out, pinning Kraven to the floorboards.

For the first time, Kraven looked trapped. But even bound, the hunter laughed. He raised his hand — a small detonator glinting in the half-light.

“No cage holds the lion,” he whispered.

Peter’s heart dropped.

The world erupted.

Explosions ripped through the walls, the warehouse shuddering as fire and smoke poured upward. Debris crashed from the ceiling, steel and concrete splitting apart.

Outside, Gwen and Miles turned in horror as the building imploded, the night lit by the inferno. Sandman and Felicia, racing back from their mission, froze at the sight of the fireball.

Inside, Peter staggered. His Spider-Sense flickered, dulled by the venom. He never saw the dagger until it plunged deep into his chest. The force knocked him backward, blood blooming beneath his suit.

Kraven ripped himself free from the webbing, but before he could flee, a roar thundered through the wreckage. Lizard charged, ramming him into the ground. Claws slashed, fists pounded — Kraven’s laughter finally silenced beneath the fury of Curt Connors unleashed.

Peter’s voice, faint and broken, whispered through the chaos.

“Curt…”

The Lizard froze, his monstrous eyes softening at the sound. He turned, and the sight nearly undid him: Peter, slumped, blood spilling, debris raining from above.

With a desperate roar, Curt gathered Spider-Man into his arms. He barreled toward the exit, but the ceiling gave way, collapsing in fire and steel. There was no escape.

So, Lizard did the only thing left. He threw his body over Peter’s, shielding him as the building came down.

The fire burned for minutes that felt like hours. Rescue crews clawed through the wreckage, joined by Flint’s towering sand and Gwen’s frantic scanning. Every second felt heavier than the last, hoping to thinn with the smoke.

Then — movement.

The rubble shifted. A clawed hand broke free. Lizard stumbled into the open, his body shredded, his breath ragged. In his arms, limp and broken, was Spider-Man.

“Help him…” Curt’s voice was raw, almost human. “He’s getting cold…”

They rushed forward. Gwen tore off the mask, her hands trembling. Peter’s face was pale; his lips stained with blood. The steel bars had pierced deep through Lizards body, crushing organs, poison still thick in his veins.

“No,” Gwen whispered. “No, no, no…”

Miles screamed, collapsing beside him. “This can’t happen!”

Felicia covered her mouth, tears spilling. Even Flint — hardened, scarred — lowered his head in silence.

The police dragged Kraven’s body from the ruins, lifeless beneath the debris. But no one cared. Their eyes were on Peter.

The man who had given them everything was slipping away.

*The Funeral*

It was private. No headlines, no crowds — just family, and the people whose lives Peter had touched without ever asking for recognition.

Among them stood the passengers he had saved on the train during his battle with Doctor Octopus — the ones who carried him back inside with quiet reverence, who kept his secret without hesitation.

The little girl he saved from the burning apartment years ago was there too, now older, holding the hands of her parents.

And at the back, half-hidden but unmistakably present, was the man who had stood outside that same burning building, the one who watched Peter risk his life even when he had no powers at all. (The Black Dude, he also stood up to Green Goblin on the bridge along with the other when Spider-Man was saving MK and the kids in the tram)

JJ Jameson, Betty Brant, Robbert Robertson, Hoffman, and some other staff of Daily Bugle also attended the funeral.

They all stood together as Peter Parker’s casket was lowered beside Uncle Ben, Aunt May, and Mary Jane.

The stone carried no mask, no emblem, no mention of Spider-Man — only his name, and the legacy he left behind.

One by one, they spoke:

Gwen:

“I was angry at him once. I thought that he used me, thought he betrayed me. But Peter… he never wanted to hurt anyone. He told me the truth when he didn’t have to. He asked me to help him build something better — and he made me believe I could.”

Dr. Connors:

“He helped me follow my curiosity beyond my current major. Funding my research and further education in genetics pushed me to keep learning. He gave me a purpose again. And though I couldn’t save MJ… or him… I’ll honor his gift every day.”

Flint:

“He didn’t see a criminal in me. He saw a father who was desperate to save his daughter. The first thing he thought of was my daughter. He gave me a chance to be more than my mistakes. I’ll never forget that.”

Miles:

“When my dad was killed, I thought my family would never stand again. But Mr. Parker walked into our lives. He carried us when we couldn’t carry ourselves. He gave me a future. I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to live up to what he stood for.”

The casket lowered. Earth covered the wood. Silence lingered.

Everyone enters inside Peter’s old home, where they see their stuff, old photographs, etc. Gwen prepares tea for everyone and they talk to each other about Peter, meanwhile Miles visit Peter’s room where he stumbles into his old work.

*Four Years Later*

Jumping four years ahead, Miles has graduated from college. Every one of his friends and his mother came to his inauguration. His mother wept with pride, his friends cheering.

*A Couple of Years Later*

<a name="_int_f5xka1kj"></a>Oscorp flourished under Gwen’s leadership, with Connors as chief engineer, teaching new generations. Flint stood tall as head of security, Felicia beside him. Flint’s daughter’s music is playing on the radio.

Miles Morales worked as a young scientist, carrying Peter’s vision forward.

But the city still needed something more.

One evening, Miles sat in a café, sipping coffee, when voices rose outside. People whispered of Spider-Man swinging through the streets, saving lives, fighting a new villain — Mr. Negative.

Miles smiled. He receives a notification through a wrist device. He rose, excusing himself, and slipped away.

On Oscorp’s rooftop, he pulled open the terrace door. The suit clung to his body; the mask smoothed in his hands. Gwen’s voice crackled in his ear, steady and guiding.

He closed his eyes, whispering to the night.

“Watch over me, Mr. Parker.”

He puts on the mask, then he leapt, soaring into the skyline, the city lights blazing beneath him.

A new Spider-Man was in action.

THE END.
