## CHAPTER 1: PRESENT

_October 25, 2026_

The world was quiet in a way it hadn't been for decades. Cities pulsed with life; children played in streets once shadowed by fear, and people carried themselves with a kind of lightness born from safety. The scars of the past remained-monuments, memories, and names etched in stone-but peace had settled in like a fragile, hard-earned dawn.

It had been ten years since the Tragedy, the event that changed everything. In the years that followed, crime fell, wars slowed, and for the first time in generations, the people believed they could hold their future in their own hands. The Justice League, having carried the burden of the world for so long, stepped back. They had won their impossible war. They entrusted the mantle of protection not to gods or legends, but to ordinary men and women: the police, governments, and a new generation still finding their way.

For the League, the fight was over. For the first time in their lives, they could simply… live.

_Bruce Wayne (Batman)_

At Wayne Manor, laughter echoed where once only silence reigned. Bruce Wayne-once the Batman, Gotham's relentless guardian-sat with his family. Years ago, he had married Selina Kyle (Catwoman), and together they adopted Damian, the boy who now stood at the edge of adulthood. Today was Damian's first day of college, and the usually reserved Bruce found himself quietly proud, though he hid it beneath a calm exterior.

Dick Grayson, once Robin and later Nightwing, also lived under the Manor's roof. Married to Starfire, he carried himself with the ease of someone who had finally found balance between two worlds.

There were absences too. Alfred Pennyworth, the heart of the Manor, had passed away three years after the Tragedy. The loss was still felt-his absence hung in the spaces between conversations, in the quiet corners of the home. Yet Bruce often thought Alfred would have been proud to see the family whole again.

_Diana (Wonder Woman)_

Far away, across the seas, Diana had returned to Themyscira. There, she walked the sunlit courtyards of her home, assisting her mother in ruling their people. Her days were spent strengthening ties between the hidden island and the outside world, becoming a bridge between realms. Though her sword was sheathed, the Amazon warrior still carried herself with a readiness that suggested peace was something she guarded, not something she took for granted.

_Barry Allen (The Flash)_

In Central City, Barry Allen traded the crimson blur of The Flash for a lab coat. At S.T.A.R. Labs, he now served as head of the energy department, his mind as quick as his feet once were. Working alongside Victor Stone, the two had ushered in breakthroughs in science that reshaped industries, powering cities more cleanly than ever before.

Barry's personal life was just as full. He and Iris West had adopted a daughter, and today, their home was filled with balloons and streamers for her birthday. Henry Allen, Barry's father, stood in the corner with a smile Barry had waited his whole life to see. Pride radiated from him, not just in Barry's heroics, but in the life his son had built.

_Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) & Arthur Curry (Aquaman)_

Among the stars, Hal Jordan remained the Green Lantern, his oath still binding him to protect far-flung worlds. His adventures were constant, but Earth always called him home.

Beneath the ocean, Arthur Curry ruled Atlantis with Mera at his side. As king and queen, they balanced duty and diplomacy, often bridging conflicts between the surface world and their underwater kingdom. Arthur had grown into his crown, no longer just the outsider torn between two worlds, but a leader proud of both.

_Billy Batson (Shazam)_

Billy Batson had grown up faster than most ever should. A boy granted the power of gods; he had carried burdens that belonged on older shoulders. Now in his mid-twenties, he had begun to find his own balance between the two lives that defined him. By day, he worked as a journalist for a small but rising news outlet in Fawcett City-an echo of the man he had once admired most, Clark Kent. By night, when duty called, he still bore the lightning, the mantle of Shazam.

Unlike many of the others, Billy hadn't retired. The magic of the wizard still coursed through him, binding him to his role as champion. But with the world at peace, the threats he faced were smaller, subtler-mystical disturbances, fractured realms, whispers of chaos that never reached the headlines. Few even realized that the red-clad figure who occasionally streaked across the sky was the same boy who once cracked jokes while standing beside the greatest heroes alive.

He lived modestly, quietly, though his found family-the other foster kids who had once been his siblings-in-arms-remained close. They had grown, too, scattered into colleges, careers, and lives of their own, but the bond never broke. Billy carried their laughter with him like armor.

Yet sometimes, when lightning split the sky on stormy nights, he wondered if the peace the world enjoyed was only the calm before another storm.

_Wayne Manor: A Call_

One evening, an envelope arrived at Wayne Manor. It bore the seal of Gotham's mayor, James Gordon-once Commissioner, now a friend carrying the weight of leadership in quieter times. Inside was an invitation: a memorial program in honor of Metropolis, the city lost during the Tragedy.

Bruce read it in silence, then reached for an old device resting in his study: his League communicator. Though retired, the bonds of the League were never truly severed. He recorded a simple message, his voice low but steady, and sent it across the globe, summoning his friends once more.

The responses came quickly. Diana accepted, Barry and Billy with enthusiasm, Arthur with measured respect. Even Hal promised to return from the stars. Each reply carried a warmth that reminded Bruce they were more than a team-they were family.

But one message hung unanswered. The one addressed to Clark Kent.

Superman did not reply.

And in the quiet that followed, Bruce felt the faintest shadow pass over the peace they had all fought so hard to protect.

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE EVENT

The evening air in Gotham carried a crisp bite, autumn leaves tumbling down the old city streets as if even the season wished to pay tribute. Floodlights washed the grand façade of City Hall in gold and white; the building draped in banners stitched with the symbol of Metropolis-a reminder of a city that no longer stood.

Inside, the great hall was filled to its brim. Rows of seats lined the marble floor, and portraits of the fallen decorated the walls. Families, officials, survivors-people from every walk of life had gathered, their voices hushed by the weight of memory. At the front, a section of seats had been reserved, subtly set apart.

One by one, they arrived.

Bruce Wayne walked in with Selina at his side, Damian trailing slightly behind in his crisp college jacket. His presence drew whispers, but not the kind born from scandal-these were murmurs of recognition, respect, of memories that could never be forgotten.

Diana was next, her poise regal even in civilian attire. She carried herself with the grace of Themyscira but smiled warmly as she greeted Bruce with a firm embrace.

Barry slipped in moments later, a bouquet of flowers in his hands for the memorial. He hugged Diana and clapped Bruce on the shoulder, his easy grin lighting the otherwise somber atmosphere. Iris and their daughter followed, the girl tugging at Barry's hand with wide-eyed curiosity.

Arthur entered like a tide shifting the room-broad-shouldered, formal for once in his life, but still carrying the unmistakable weight of a king. Beside him, Mera's presence glowed like the ocean at dawn. Hal Jordan arrived last, his jacket casual but his eyes scanning the hall with the instinct of a soldier who never really retired.

Then came Billy Batson.

For a heartbeat, some in the hall mistook him for just another young reporter-dressed in a pressed shirt, tie slightly loose, notebook tucked under his arm. But when Barry spotted him, his grin widened.

"Billy!" Barry called out, crossing the aisle to pull him into a hug.

The others turned, and there was a moment of warmth-nostalgia tempered with surprise. They remembered the boy who had once stumbled into their ranks with wide eyes and quick jokes. Now he was older, taller, but his smile carried the same spark of youthful energy.

Diana clasped his shoulder, her voice firm but kind. "You've grown into yourself, Champion. The League is proud of you."

Arthur gave him a smirk. "Still look like a kid to me," he muttered, though his tone was teasing rather than dismissive.

Billy chuckled, scratching the back of his neck. "Guess some things don't change. But it's good to see you all again. Really good."

Bruce, ever reserved, simply nodded. "We're glad you came." And though his words were few, Billy caught the weight behind them-the acknowledgment that he belonged among them, not as the boy they remembered, but as a peer.

For a brief moment, time seemed to stop. The League, once scattered across worlds, was together again. Their smiles, their quiet greetings, the clasping of hands-these were not the gestures of heroes, but of friends who had bled together and somehow found peace.

They took their seats, laughter softening the edges of grief, though it could never erase it.

Then, the applause began.

James Gordon, older now yet still carrying the same iron steadiness, walked onto the stage. His suit was plain, his presence anything but. He approached the podium, letting the crowd's respect wash over him before raising a hand for silence.

"Good evening," he began, his voice steady, though tinged with the gravity of the night. "My name is James Gordon, and I stand before you not just as the mayor of Gotham, but as a man who has carried the memory of too many lost friends."

The hall stilled.

"Tonight, we gather to remember the innocent lives taken from us ten years ago-the men, women, and children of Metropolis, whose city was consumed in the nuclear fire. We remember those who perished, and those who lived on, bearing scars that no time will ever heal."

Gordon's voice caught briefly, but he pressed on.

"It was more than the loss of a city. For many, it was the loss of hope. Metropolis was a beacon to the world, a symbol of light in the darkest times. To see it fall was to believe, if only for a moment, that perhaps the light could never return."

The camera lingered on Bruce, his jaw set tight, the shadows of memory flickering behind his eyes. Around him, his friends sat in silence, each carrying their own ghosts.

"And yet," Gordon continued, his voice rising, "we are here. We survived. We endure. We remember not only the loss, but the courage it inspired, the unity it demanded, and the heroes it revealed. Tonight is not only about grief-it is about remembrance, resilience, and the promise that we will never forget."

The hall erupted in solemn applause. But amid the sound, the League members exchanged quiet glances-each knowing that remembrance was only the beginning. The past had not finished with them yet.

**FLASHBACK**

_November 27, 2016_

_Gotham, Parking Garage_

Gunfire rattled against the concrete pillars, sparks leaping with each burst. Batman moved like a shadow through the chaos, cape snapping as he struck from above, his fists breaking the rhythm of the thugs' attack. But there were too many, their submachine guns spraying wild arcs across the dimly lit garage.

A muzzle flash from the corner. A bullet, too close-

And then, a blur of red and blue.

Superman caught the round mid-flight as if plucking dust from the air. The shockwave of his arrival sent loose papers flying. In the space of heartbeats, he disarmed the gunmen, bent steel like twigs, and bound them in twisted railings. The fight was over before most could blink.

Batman tightened the last set of restraints, scowling beneath the cowl.

"I didn't need your help. I can protect myself."

Superman didn't rise to the bait, only offered a calm nod.

"I know. I just wanted to talk."

Batman paused, weighing him, then jerked his head upward. "Terrace."

_Gotham Rooftop, Minutes Later_

The night was cold, wind sweeping across the rooftop. The city glowed beneath them, neon clashing with shadow. Batman stood with arms folded, a figure of stone. Superman hovered a moment before landing, his cape whispering against the gravel.

"So," Batman said, low, "you wanted to talk."

Superman hesitated-rare for him. "Yeah. It's about…"

Batman cut in, his voice edged with dry certainty.

"Your wife's pregnant."

Clark blinked, stunned. "Wait-what? How-when-?"

Batman's eyes narrowed, though a ghost of amusement tugged at his voice.

"You've been nervous. Restless. But you can't hide the joy."

Clark let out a laugh, disbelief giving way to relief. "You're unbelievable." He shook his head, smiling now. "You're right. Lois is pregnant. I already called my parents. They can't wait-they're leaving Smallville to visit us."

Batman turned slightly, so the city lights hid the faint smile under his cowl.

"I'm happy for you."

Clark's eyes softened. "I even thought about the godfather."

For a moment, Batman didn't answer. His silence was louder than words, though Clark caught the glimmer of warmth behind the mask.

Superman grinned. "Alright. I'll see you around, Bruce."

And with that, he leapt into the sky, a streak of light vanishing into the stars.

_Sunrise - S.T.A.R. Labs_

The scene was chaos. Police tape cut across the entrance, scientists huddled in confusion, security officers shouting into radios. Batman slipped past them all, emerging into the lab's scorched interior.

"What happened here?" he demanded.

A shaken scientist stepped forward. "It's a theft. Somebody stole the kryptonite samples we were experimenting on."

Before Batman could respond, the air shifted. Superman landed hard, his face pale with fear.

"Bruce-" His voice cracked. "I can't find Lois."

Batman's chest tightened. "…What?" Then, curtly: "And the name."

Superman swallowed, correcting himself. "Lois. She's gone."

Batman turned sharply to the scientist. "Show me the visuals."

Together they scanned the grainy footage. The screen flickered, revealing painted faces and chaotic laughter-Joker and Harley Quinn, carrying the stolen kryptonite.

Superman's fists clenched. "They're not going to get away with this."

Without warning, he blasted upward through the ceiling, debris raining down in his wake.

Batman exhaled slowly. "I'll pay for the damage."

Over Comms

"Batman here."

The comm crackled. Barry's voice cut through, urgency sharp.

"Hey, I was checking a crime scene downtown. Found Crane's body-Scarecrow. But Bruce… he was smiling. All the stash of fear gas is missing."

Batman's gut went cold. "No. Connect every member. Now."

Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Superman all linked in.

"This is an emergency," Batman barked. "Lois Lane has been kidnapped. Jonathan Crane is dead. Joker and Harley are involved, and they have kryptonite along with fear toxin. Priority one: find them. Stop their plan. Save Lois."

The chorus came back: "Roger."

_Gotham Harbor_

Minutes later, Batman's comm buzzed again.

"Batman-it's me," Superman's voice crackled. "I found something at Gotham Harbor. Can't see inside. The walls are lined with lead. I'm going in."

"No, wait!" Batman snapped. "Don't go alone-"

But the channel cut.

Batman switched frequencies. "I'm sending Superman's coordinates. Gotham Harbor. The structure's covered in lead. Don't engage directly-Joker have Crane's fear gas. Get there fast. Batman out."

He gunned the Batpod, its roar splitting the streets.

By the time he arrived, the others were waiting. Wonder Woman's sword gleaming at her side, Green Lantern's ring flaring faint green, Cyborg's systems humming. They exchanged grim looks, each waiting for Batman's lead.

"You said he was here," Wonder Woman began, voice tight. "But we-"

A sound split the air.

Superman.

He tore through the roof of the warehouse, screaming, his face twisted in agony. In his arms-Lois, limp and unmoving. He didn't stop. He launched skyward, faster and faster.

Flash's voice cracked in horror. "Why is he-why is he taking her into space?"

"Wonder Woman, Green Lantern-stop him!" Batman roared.

They leapt into the air, streaks of gold and emerald.

Cyborg's voice came through, panicked. "Batman-inside! I'm detecting a compound. Joker and Harley are here, but Harley's critical. Joker's-he's laughing."

"Get him out," Batman ordered.

Cyborg dragged them into the light. Joker cackled through bloodied teeth, even as Batman stalked forward.

"What did you do?" Batman snarled, seizing him by the collar.

Joker's eyes gleamed with madness. "Ha ha ha! For once, I just wanted to be on the winning side."

Cyborg scanned quickly. "It's a hybrid. Fear toxin mixed with kryptonite. That's what's driving Superman mad."

Batman's grip tightened, rage simmering. Joker leaned closer, whispering through broken laughter.

"Did anybody know the lady was pregnant?"

Something inside Bruce snapped. He punched Joker so hard that he got knocked out cold.

And then-

Explosion.

The world turned white.

The shockwave roared across them, a wall of heat and sound. Gotham shook under the blast. And in the distance, where Metropolis once stood, a mushroom cloud clawed its way into the heavens.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.

Then Batman's voice, ragged, torn with fury.

"No!" He trembled, fists clenched. "No…"

He threw Joker to the ground, trembling with rage. "I'm taking him to Arkham. The rest of you-" his voice broke, then hardened- "take care of Superman."

And with that, Batman dragged the laughing clown into the shadows, leaving the others staring at the rising fire that marked the death of a city.

_Arkham Asylum_

The echo of dripping water and distant screams haunted the corridors as Batman slammed Joker into the metal chair. His cape dragged across the floor like a shadow made flesh. The overhead lamp flickered, painting half of Joker's face in light, the other in endless darkness.

Batman (furiously): "It's always been between you and me. So why Clark? Why Superman?"

Joker tilted his head, his lips curling into a grotesque smile.

Joker: "Why not? Think of it as a… test. You've always carried tragedy like a badge of honor, Bruce. I wondered-could he? Could your shining boy scout survive when his world burns? Or would he snap like everyone else?"

He let out a low, wheezing laugh that rattled the room.

The reinforced wall suddenly crumbled inward with an explosive crack. A figure stepped through the dust and debris - Superman, his eyes glowing crimson, his body trembling not with weakness but with sheer, unrestrained fury.

Superman (voice shaking, but deadly): "Give me one reason I shouldn't end him where he sits."

Joker leaned back, mocking calmness.

Joker (smirking): "Now that's the look I wanted to see…"

Batman stepped between them instantly, arms raised though he knew the futility.

Batman: "Clark, don't. I know you have every right to hate him. But if you kill him… he wins. You'll be proving his point - that even the greatest of us can fall."

Superman's fists clenched. He stalked forward, and in a blur, he had Batman by the throat, lifting him effortlessly.

Superman (through gritted teeth): "You think your way still works? You let men like him live, Bruce. And now my wife is dead. My child. My city. Everything I cared for-gone. Because you couldn't finish what needed to be done."

Batman's voice strained, his feet kicking against the air.

Batman (hoarse): "Please… don't do this…"

Superman (angrily): "Why?!"

For a moment, Batman's eyes softened, pleading not as Gotham's knight but as Clark's friend.

Batman (earnest): "Because you're hope. Not just mine. The world's. You are the reason people believe the light can outshine the dark. If you cross this line… you'll destroy more than just him. You'll destroy yourself."

Superman froze, breath heaving, the fire in his eyes dimming. Slowly, painfully, he lowered Batman back to the ground.

Batman coughed, then placed a hand on Superman's shoulder.

Batman (gently): "Clark… Lois, your parents, everyone who loved you - none of them would want this. They believed in who you are. Don't let Joker take that away. Don't let him erase what we built together."

Superman's knees buckled. He collapsed, his sobs echoing louder than the chaos of Arkham's halls. Batman caught him, holding him close, the Dark Knight becoming-for once-a source of comfort instead of fear.

From the chair, Joker's cackle cut through the moment like broken glass.

Joker (mock applause): "Bravo! What a performance. Shakespeare couldn't have written it better."

Batman didn't hesitate. He slammed a shock device into Joker's chest, the laughter cutting off in a spasm before unconsciousness claimed him.

He hoisted Superman up and guided him out.

_Outside Arkham_

The pale afternoon light felt heavier than nightfall as the League waited outside in silence. Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern and Cyborg stood in a quiet semicircle. Their expressions fell as they saw Superman's broken frame.

Wonder Woman stepped forward, voice soft but unwavering.

Wonder Woman: "Clark… I'm so sorry. We all are."

Superman looked at each of them in turn. The invincible hero now looked… hollow.

He stepped back, rising into the air, his cape trembling in the wind.

Batman: "Clark! Where are you going?"

Superman's voice cracked, half a whisper, half a farewell.

Superman: "They called me hope. But my hope… is gone. My family, my city, my connection to this world. How can I be a symbol when I'm nothing inside?"

He rose higher, his gaze locking with Bruce's one last time.

Superman: "Don't lose your way, Bruce. Keep the dream alive. For both of us."

And with that, Superman turned skyward and vanished into the stars, leaving silence and heartbreak in his wake.

The League stood motionless, the weight of what they'd lost pressing on all of them. Batman didn't move, didn't speak. For the first time, the League looked leaderless.

**PRESENT**

_Event: Gotham City Hall_

The camera lingers on Bruce Wayne's face as Gordon's words fade into the hall. His expression is stone, but behind his eyes the weight of memory lingers-the loss of a friend, of a symbol, of a future that might have been.

Mayor Gordon's voice breaks the silence, steady but heavy with remembrance.

Gordon:

"After that day, Superman never returned. And perhaps he never will. What happened was not just his tragedy-it was ours. Our failure. Our irresponsibility and our blindness allowed it to happen. And so, we-the people, the leaders, the guardians-took responsibility.

We strengthened our laws. We stood firm against the corruption and the chaos that had consumed our cities for too long. In two short years, Gotham's most notorious criminals were behind bars. Some never returned.

Today, we live in a peace forged not only by heroes, but by the will of ordinary men and women who vowed never to let such darkness rise again. And so we remember… not just the countless lives lost in Metropolis, but the legacy they left us.

Fair justice. A safer tomorrow. A world worthy of those who did not live long enough to see this day."

The hall falls into hushed silence. The camera slowly pans across the League-older, quieter, no longer gods among men but human beings carrying scars. For a moment, all of them steal a glance at Bruce. He does not return it. His eyes remain forward, fixed on something only he can see.

---

## CHAPTER 3: REGRET

The night was quiet on the edge of Metropolis, where the city's ruins met the Gotham highway. Rising above the silence stood the memorial grounds. At its center, a towering statue of Superman reached toward the stars, his cape cast in bronze and caught in a sculpted wind, as though he were still guarding the world from above. Spotlights from below lit the figure, his shadow stretching across rows of stone markers engraved with the names of thousands who had perished that day.

The League gathered at the base of the memorial. Diana's hand brushed the carved names as if she could feel the lives behind them. Barry stood stiller than anyone had ever seen him, his usual energy subdued. Hal kept his arms crossed, not out of arrogance, but to hide the tremor in his fingers. Even Arthur, so rarely moved by surface traditions, lowered his head in silence.

Billy Batson lingered a little apart from the rest, his hands shoved into his jacket pockets. He looked small among legends, a boy who had once carried the power of gods, staring up at the man he had admired most. His lips moved as if whispering something-maybe a prayer, maybe just a word of thanks-but no sound reached the others.

Bruce stood with Selina at his side; his eyes fixed on a single stone: Lois Lane. The engraving was simple, but for Bruce it carried more weight than any monument could.

He broke the silence, his voice rough with grief.

Bruce (quietly, to Selina):

"It's been ten years since the unthinkable happened. And still… I carry it like it was yesterday. For so long, I thought the weight would break me. I thought I'd never live with this burden… until you."

He turned, meeting Selina's eyes.

Bruce (softer):

"You saved me. Reminded me that as long as people still need us, there's more we can do than mourn. You made me see… I could still be of use. Even in a world without him."

Selina's hand slipped into his, grounding him as the others stood in solemn silence. The statue loomed above them, not just a monument, but a reminder of the hope they had lost-and the promise they still had to keep.

**FLASHBACK**

_(20 November 2020)_

Rain pours down over Gotham. The neon reflections ripple across puddles, and the sound of thunder echoes in the distance. Selina Kyle, in full Catwoman gear, leaps across the rooftops of a lower district. Her movements are sleek, but her eyes narrow when she spots something unusual on a nearby building.

Batman stands there-unmasked, motionless. No fight, no crime scene. Just… him. She frowns. Then, before she can react, he steps off the ledge. A grappling rope tightens around his neck.

Catwoman (sharply, panicked): "No!"

Selina sprints across the slick rooftop, claws sparking against stone as she leaps, cuts the rope mid-air, and snares him with her whip. They crash down together on the soaked pavement. She braces his fall, landing hard. Both are drenched. Batman is gasping, trembling, sobbing.

Catwoman (furious, shaken): "What the hell do you think you were doing?!"

(she lowers her tone, seeing his face) "…Bruce?"

He doesn't look at her. His shoulders shake as rain hides his tears.

Catwoman: "I heard about Alfred… I'm sorry. I should've been there. I had no idea how bad it was for you. I thought-you'd pull through. Like always."

Batman (broken, low): "After Superman left… I buried it all. Focused on the mission. On responsibility. I thought I could fill the hole with purpose. But Gotham… Gotham doesn't need me anymore. We won. We made this city better. Crimes fallen. And me? I'm still lost in the dark."

(his voice cracks) "I thought maybe… it was time to end it."

Catwoman (kneels closer, firm but tender): "Maybe Gotham doesn't need Batman anymore. But Bruce Wayne? The world still needs him. You can still help. You can still live. You can still be more than the mask."

Bruce finally looks at her-drenched, vulnerable, broken.

Catwoman: "You don't get to punish yourself for sins that weren't yours, Bruce. You owe yourself more than that."

There's a long pause. Bruce steadies his breath. For the first time in years, a small, weary smile forms.

Batman (softly): "…Thank you, Selina."

He picks up the mask from her hand, stares at it for a beat, then pulls it on again.

_The Watchtower_

Moments later, Batman enters the Watchtower. The League is gathered-Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Green Lantern and Shazam. He places his comm on the table, his voice heavy but resolved.

Batman: "I'm retiring from the League. The world doesn't need Batman anymore. Not like before. But… there are other ways I can help. Ways Bruce Wayne can matter."

The room is silent. Then Diana steps forward.

Wonder Woman (gently): "Truth is, Bruce… we've been feeling the same. We've all thought about it."

To his surprise, she removes her comm and sets it beside his. One by one, the others follow.

Flash (trying to ease the weight): "Let's face it, big guy… nothing world-shaking events happened in years. Not the kind that needs us."

Aquaman: "It's time to move forward. To live."

Green Lantern: "You're right, Batman. There's more we can do… outside of this."

Bruce looks around, humbled. He bows his head.

Batman: "Thank you… all of you. It means more than you know. Keep your comms. If the world ever needs us again, we'll be ready. And… if you ever need resources, talk to Bruce Wayne."

They all turn their gaze toward the "S" symbol carved into the Watchtower wall-a silent tribute. Bruce's voice lingers in his thoughts.

Batman (internal): "Thank you, Clark… for believing in us."

_The Batcave_

Bruce and Selina stand inside the cave for the last time in costume. One by one, they lock away the suit, the gadgets, the mantle itself. Bruce places a hand on the glass case holding the cowl-like saying goodbye to an old friend.

He turns to Dick and Damian, entrusting them with the legacy. They nod in solemn respect.

Bruce looks at Selina. She reaches for his hand. For the first time in a long time, he allows himself to let go. Together, hand in hand, they leave the cave. Above, the storm breaks-the faintest glimpse of dawn beyond the rain.

**PRESENT**

Bruce's voice catches as a single tear slips down his cheek. He turns to Selina, his gaze soft yet unshakable.

Bruce: "Thank you… for everything you've done for me. You believed in me when I was at my lowest, when I thought the only way forward was to end it all. You reminded me that there's a purpose beyond Batman."

The camera slowly pans across the Wayne Foundation's projects - schools, shelters, medical wings, community centers - all glowing under the night lights. Lives changed, futures saved.

Bruce (his voice breaking, but resolute): "I love you, Selina."

Selina (smiling through emotion): "I love you too."

The League stands quietly around them, their old friend no longer just the Dark Knight but a man who has found peace. Barry steps forward with a grin that can't hide his emotion.

Barry: "We're proud of you, Bruce."

Diana (firm, warm): "We all are."

Hal, Arthur, J'onn, Billy, and the others nod in unison. For a moment, the night feels lighter. The group drifts into laughter and gentle conversation, sharing memories of battles long past, victories that once defined them, and friendships that still endure. It feels almost like old times - the golden days rekindled beneath the stars.

_Outer Space - The Oncoming Storm_

But beyond Earth's fragile peace, the cosmos stirs. Vast and merciless, a fleet of alien warships cuts through the black void. Their hulls shimmer with the fires of conquest, their engines thrum like the beating heart of a god of war.

At the center vessel, cloaked in shadow, stands Darkseid. His towering form radiates authority and menace as molten fire glows faintly in his eyes. Behind him, legions of Parademons prepare for battle, their screeches echoing through the massive chamber.

Darkseid (a low growl, almost reverent): "After ten years… Earth has grown complacent. Its protectors… soft."

He raises a gauntleted hand. The chamber falls silent.

Darkseid: "Now… they will learn despair."

The camera pulls back, revealing the endless fleet moving relentlessly toward Earth, blotting out the stars as the drums of war begin to beat.

---

## CHAPTER 4: EPIC BATTLE

The void of space trembles with the arrival of a god of conquest. Darkseid's fleet, endless and merciless, advances upon Earth like a tide of steel and fire. The Watchtower - once the League's silent guardian in orbit - looms in their path. Darkseid narrows his burning eyes. A single command is given, and the flagship's cannons roar.

In an instant, the Watchtower is obliterated. Its once proud form fractures into flaming shards, hurtling toward Earth's atmosphere like falling stars of ruin.

_Gotham - The Gathering Storm_

In the city below, alarms blare across League communicators… then silence. Bruce Wayne's eyes harden as static fills the channels. He doesn't need confirmation - there is only one explanation for the sudden blackout. He steps outside with the others, watching as the fragments of the Watchtower streak across the night sky.

Bruce: "The comms are dead. Only one force could've done this."

Diana's gaze sharpened, her bracelets already crackling faintly with divine energy. Hal Jordan's ring blazed brighter than it had in years, and beside him, Billy Batson whispered a word that split the sky with thunder. In a burst of light, the boy was gone - replaced by the champion of Shazam, stronger and steadier than the League remembered him. Cyborg's body shifted seamlessly into battle mode, his systems linking to satellites across the globe.

Arthur's trident pulsed with ancient magic, currents surging around him as he summoned Mera to rally Atlantis. Overhead, storm clouds gathered at his call. The air itself seemed to brace for war.

_Wayne Manor - Securing the Family_

Bruce (to Barry): "Help me get Selina, Dick, and Damian to the manor. Then scout for anything unusual."

Barry: "On it."

The Flash blurred into motion, faster than the eye could follow. But this was no longer the rookie sprinter the League once knew. Every step cracked with arcs of blue-white lightning - Barry running closer to the heart of the Speed Force than ever before, and he has control over his speed like he never had before. In moments, Selina, Dick, and Damian stood safely inside Wayne Manor. In the Batcave below, they suited up, the shadows of Gotham's future protectors preparing for their part in the storm to come.

_In the Skies - The First Response_

Above the city, Wonder Woman took flight, her armor glinting as golden light surged along her blade. Hal Jordan's constructs, vast and sharp-edged, shielded entire blocks from raining debris. Billy, with a roar of thunder, shattered a falling starship fragment into dust. Cyborg unleashed hard-light wings, propelling himself upward to intercept more wreckage.

The Titans joins the formation, they are now more grown and stronger than before. Star Fire, whose body is flaming like comet, locked eyes with Hal.

Starfire: "Go higher, Lantern. We need to know what's coming."

Green Lantern broke atmosphere, emerald engines burning behind him. And then he froze. The void ahead of him was not stars… it was ships. Dozens. Hundreds. A fleet that could swallow worlds. And at its center - Darkseid, silent, watching.

Green Lantern (through comms, voice tense): "This… is bigger than anything we've faced. Darkseid is here. With an army."

_The Batcave - War Council_

Static cleared as Bruce's systems cut through interference. His voice carried across the team's comms, calm, commanding, unshaken.

Bruce: "Status report."

Hal: "Confirmed. Darkseid's fleet. The Watchtower's gone."

For a moment, silence. Then Diana stepped forward, her voice steady as steel.

Diana: "Then there's no doubt. Whatever his reason… we must stop him here."

Bruce: "Agreed. We need everyone - every ally, every nation, every kingdom. Arthur, Diana - rally your people. The rest of you, prepare to face the parademons and move civilians to safety. Tonight, the League returns. Not for vengeance… but for the world."

Across the globe, heroes ready themselves. Kingdoms stir. Cities brace. And above them all, Darkseid's fleet continues its descent, the promise of annihilation drawing closer with every passing second.

Above them all, the shadow of Darkseid's fleet grew larger… and closer.

**BARREN METROPPOLIS**

The once-proud city stood silent-its ruins marked by scars of the past war. Now, its barren ground became the battlefield for another.

From the skies, Atlantean warships breach the clouds, their glowing engines reflecting off the shattered skyline. From the opposite side, Themysciran aircrafts thunder into formation, banners of the Amazons rippling. The two armies land in unison, shaking the ground.

Diana strides forward, armor gleaming brighter than ever, meeting her mother at the frontlines. Their embrace is brief; their eyes hardened with purpose.

Arthur descends into the fray, clasping forearms with Mera before raising his trident to the Atlantean legions.

Titans are preparing their formation as the final line of defense behind the battlefield, so any parademons wouldn't escape and attack civilians. (Superboy (Connor Kent), Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Miss Martian, Kid Flash, Aqualad, and others)

Meanwhile, in the Batcave, Robin, Nightwing, and Catwoman prepare to deploy.

Bruce watches them leave. His hand lingers on the console before he speaks under his breath:

Bruce (grimly): "I never thought I'd have to use this."

The chamber opens. Inside rests the Hellbat Armor, its obsidian frame pulsing faintly with crimson energy. As it begins to seal around him, the sound reverberates like a war drum.

Above, three colossal ships break through the atmosphere, blotting out the moonlight. Their hulls glow with infernal fire. From the central one, a massive portal tears open reality itself.

Darkseid steps forth. Each stride is heavy enough to crack the Earth beneath him. His gaze sweeps across the gathered forces like a god surveying ants.

The doors of the ships open, releasing endless ranks of parademons-mutated soldiers of every kind, some larger, faster, armored-an evolved army unlike anything seen before. They form up behind him, awaiting only his command.

Diana steps forward, shield raised, taking charge of the army of heroes.

Wonder Woman: "Why return now, Darkseid? What is it you seek?"

Darkseid (darkly): "To conquer the only world that ever defied me. And this time… the Kryptonian will not come."

His eyes drift to the back of towering Superman statue, standing solemn amidst the ruins.

Darkseid (snarling): "Look at this mockery. You worship a coward who abandoned you. His name should be erased from history."

His eyes ignite-Omega Beams lance out, streaking toward the statue.

But in a flash of light-CLANG!-Diana's shield intercepts, the beams ricocheting into the ground. Dust and fire erupt, but she stands firm.

Wonder Woman (defiant): "Superman's legacy lives in us. And you'll fall to it again."

Darkseid raises his arm, his voice a roar that shakes the battlefield.

Darkseid: "Kill them all."

The parademons surge forward. The Justice League charges to meet them, leading their armies.

Flash blazes through the battlefield like lightning incarnate, striking swarms before they can take flight.

Arthur channels the oceans themselves, waves of water erupting from underground reservoirs, sweeping demons into the air for his trident.

Green Lantern forges titanic constructs-giant cannons, shields, and blades-obliterating hordes.

At the heart of the storm, Diana and Shazam clash with Darkseid himself. Thunder cracks as Billy calls down the lightning, his strength evenly matched against the tyrant's brute force. Diana's blade slices across his armor, sparks flying.

Meanwhile, deep in the Batcave, the Hellbat systems hum louder, syncing to Bruce's heartbeat. His eyes glow red within the helmet.

Batman (to himself, low): "It's time."

Robin, Nightwing and Catwoman slice through the air in their aero-dynamic suits, weaving between parademons. They clash with swarms in midair, then dive to the ground with acrobatic precision, striking hard before taking off again. Their suits hum with new propulsion tech, making them faster, sharper, fearless.

They fight alongside Titans at the end of the line, not letting any parademons escape the battlefield.

At the center, Wonder Woman and Shazam unleash their full might against Darkseid. Diana's blade screeches against his armor, sparks flying like lightning. Shazam hurls bolt after bolt, thunder exploding across the ruins. But Darkseid hardly falters-his movements precise, his face calm. He hasn't even broken a sweat.

The rest of the League joins in-Green Lantern raining down massive constructs, Aquaman summoning spears of water, Cyborg firing concentrated plasma cannons. Even their combined effort meets a wall as Darkseid raises his hand-Omega Beams erupt, scattering the heroes like ragdolls.

Suddenly-BOOM!

A pair of explosives detonate against Darkseid's arm, flooding the battlefield with smoke and static. The tyrant stumbles back, vision blurred.

From the haze, a black and crimson silhouette descends. The Hellbat Armor-sleek, shifting, alive with nanotech. AI-guided plating tightens to Bruce's form as crimson energy ripples from the bat insignia.

The battlefield goes silent. Everyone stares.

Wonder Woman (tense): "Bruce… no."

Cyborg (alarmed): "That suit drains his life-force. He won't last long."

Bruce's voice comes through, steady, amplified.

Batman: "Flash. I need as much power as you can generate. Now."

Barry swallows nervously, looking at Bruce in dread.

Flash: "Okay! Here goes nothing."

He blurs away, tearing through the city in streaks of lightning, building momentum.

Darkseid's vision clears. He smirks.

Darkseid: "So… the Bat has come. I was wondering when you'd crawl out of your hole."

He unleashes twin Omega Beams straight at Bruce.

But the Hellbat chest insignia absorbs them-energy coursing through its veins, glowing brighter, hotter-before discharging it back in a titanic blast. The ground splits open as Darkseid takes the hit, sliding backward, momentarily stunned.

His grin grows.

Darkseid (amused): "Impressive."

Bruce lowers into stance.

Batman: "Let's do this."

The armor shifts-cloaking technology flickers-and he vanishes.

Darkseid's eyes dart around. A blur-CRASH!-a gauntlet slams into his jaw. Another-THUD!-to his chest. He swings wildly, but each strike comes from nowhere. The League seizes the opening, rallying behind Batman's unseen assault, their attacks forcing the parademons back.

Then-fzzzt!-the invisibility drops. Batman stands visible, his breathing heavier.

Narration (voice-over tone): The Hellbat feeds on his very life to function. Every second burns away another piece of him.

He activates the armor's super-speed, moving like a scarlet blur himself. He and Shazam attack in tandem-thunder and shadow striking in perfect rhythm. Each blow lands faster, harder, unrelenting.

Darkseid grows restless, swinging heavier, each miss gouging craters into the ground. His patience finally snaps. His eyes blaze brighter than ever.

Omega Beams roar out-more intense, more lethal.

Batman braces, the armor absorbing it once again, siphoning every drop. The energy channels into the insignia, surging beyond capacity. With a guttural roar, Bruce fires it all back in one concentrated blast, slamming Darkseid off his feet.

The battlefield quakes. Smoke rises. Darkseid kneels, his armor singed, his eyes burning with rage.

Bruce stumbles, his knees nearly giving way. The Hellbat pulses erratically, warning alarms echoing inside his HUD. Its systems are feeding off his metabolism faster than his body can endure.

Batman (low, strained): "Not… yet."

He clenches his fists, forcing himself upright-ready to keep fighting, even if it kills him.

Darkseid (taunting): "Are you already tired, Bat? All that power… and you're still just a man inside a coffin."

Bruce's voice cuts through, ragged but commanding.

Batman: "Diana. Hal. Restrain him."

Wonder Woman surges forward, her lasso blazing golden light as it coils around Darkseid's arm. Green Lantern summons massive chains of emerald energy, locking the tyrant's other side. Together, they pull, straining against his sheer power.

Batman: "Shazam-lightning. Now."

Shazam nods, he holds Darkseid in a neck hold, standing behind him, his voice thundering.

Shazam: "SHAZAM!"

The skies crack open. Bolts of divine lightning crash down, striking Darkseid's body again and again, forcing his muscles to seize. His roar echoes like a beast in agony, but still he resists, his knees refusing to buckle.

Bruce's voice sharpens.

Batman: "Flash. It's now or never."

A blur flickers across the battlefield, circling the globe in a heartbeat. Barry's lightning arcs brighter, louder, until the air itself screams with energy. He appears beside Bruce, vibrating with barely-contained power.

Flash (smirking, breathless): "Yeah, I'm already here."

Batman (to Aquaman): "Arthur. When this is over, take care of us."

Arthur gives a solemn nod, trident in hand.

Aquaman: "Count on it."

Bruce spreads his nano-tech cape, the wings unfolding like molten steel. The armor lifts him into the air, crimson energy streaming off the insignia.

Flash looks up, meeting Bruce's eyes. Without hesitation, he leaps. His hand collides with Batman's gauntlet-CRACK!-and the Speed Force energy pours into the Hellbat like a dam bursting.

Barry's body goes limp, dropping from the sky. Aquaman leaps forward, catching him before he hits the ground. Mera rushes to his side instantly, hands glowing as she channels Atlantean healing magic into Barry's veins.

Above, Darkseid looks up as the shadow eclipses him-a colossal Bat-symbol burning in the sky as the Hellbat armor overloads with Flash's power.

Bruce's voice echoes through the comms, calm despite the strain:

Batman: "I am not going let you destroy the world Superman entrusted us to protect."

The insignia flares white-hot. A cataclysmic blast erupts from Bruce's chest, shaped like wings stretching across the battlefield. Diana, Hal, and Shazam dive clear at the last second as the beam slams into Darkseid point-blank.

The explosion tears the ground open, shockwaves flattening parademons in every direction. The sound is like thunder multiplied a thousandfold, echoing across the ruins of Metropolis.

Nightwing, Robin and Catwoman stand frozen, watching the detonation consume everything. Their faces twist in horror.

Catwoman (shouting): "No! Bruce!"

The light fades. Smoke curls upward. At the center lies a massive crater-its outline unmistakably in the shape of the Bat symbol, scorched into the earth.

Chunks of the Hellbat armor rain down, glowing red as they fall apart. From the sky, Bruce's body plummets-lifeless, limp.

Arthur catches him mid-fall, landing heavily where the League has regrouped. He tears away the charred chest plate, revealing Bruce pale and barely breathing.

Aquaman (urgent): "Mera!"

Mera places her hands over Bruce's chest, her water magic glowing bright. She grits her teeth, forcing the healing power into his failing body.

Nightwing, Robin and Catwoman rush to his side, their faces stricken. Damian's hands tremble as he grips Bruce's arm.

Robin (breaking): "Father… please."

Nightwing swallows hard, his voice tight.

Nightwing: "He bought us time. Don't let it be the end."

The camera pulls back-the League and Titans encircled around Bruce, the bat-shaped crater smoldering in front of them. The battlefield is quiet for just a moment, every hero shaken, their leader on the edge of death… and Darkseid, still out there.

From the smoldering crater, a figure rises. Darkseid. His armor is cracked and his skin burned raw, black smoke rolling off his body. His eyes blaze with unstable omega energy, brighter and more violent than ever.

The League scrambles to their feet, bruised, exhausted, but still standing. Diana steps forward, shield raised. Hal's ring glows brighter, constructing a wall of energy around Bruce's unconscious body. Shazam clenches his fists, sparks of Zeus's lightning dancing at his knuckles.

Darkseid (snarling): "Pathetic. I think… that is all you can do."

The ground trembles beneath his steps as he advances.

Then-

A calm, steady voice cuts through the chaos.

Unknown (off-screen): "I think you're missing someone."

The battlefield freezes. Heroes and parademons alike lift their eyes skyward. Even Darkseid halts, his fury faltering into disbelief.

Above, descending from the heavens, a figure shines like a second sun. His entire body radiates golden energy, every vein coursing with the raw power of a star. His cape flutters like a banner of fire, and his eyes glow-not with wrath, but with righteous light.

It's Superman.

Gasps ripple through the League. For a decade, they had wondered if they'd ever see him again. Now here he was-transformed, reborn, impossibly powerful.

Darkseid (shaking his head, denying): "No… this is not possible. You were gone!"

With a sonic boom, he rockets downward. His kick collides with Darkseid's chest in a single, devastating blow. The shockwave tears through the battlefield, hurling Darkseid across the ruined cityscape. He crashes through a half-toppled skyscraper, disappearing in a storm of dust and fire.

The League stares in stunned silence. Clark lands softly beside Bruce's unconscious body. Kneeling, he places a glowing hand against Bruce's chest. Golden solar energy pulses outward, seeping into Bruce's body. His breathing steadies, the faint rise and fall of his chest returning.

Superman (quietly, to Bruce): "Rest, old friend. You've done enough."

He looks up, meeting the tearful eyes of Nightwing and Robin.

Superman: "Take care of him. I'll take care of this."

Dick and Damian nod, still shaken, but relief washes over them as Clark rises.

Turning, Superman hovers above the gathered heroes. His aura radiates outward in waves, touching each of them. Diana feels her wounds knit faster. Hal's ring surges with renewed energy. Billy's lightning flares brighter. Flash recovers his stamina.

Superman: "You've carried this fight for too long. Now… let me share the sun with you."

A surge of golden energy ripples through the League, empowering them all, reigniting their spirits. For the first time in years, they feel unstoppable.

The heroes gather, renewed by Superman's energy. Clark hovers above them, his golden aura lighting the ruins like a second dawn.

Superman (commanding):

"Flash, Shazam-scout the ships. Bring back everyone the parademons took, as fast as you can.

Diana, Hal-cover their path.

Arthur, Mera-rally the army, hold the ground.

I'll deal with Darkseid."

No one hesitates. They scatter into formation, trusting him instantly.

Superman streaks forward-Darkseid's omega beams ignite, splitting into two serpentine trails. But Clark's eyes blaze red, his heat vision colliding mid-air, canceling the beams in a violent explosion of light. Before Darkseid can react, Superman crashes into him, fist-first, driving him back with unstoppable force.

For the first time, Darkseid stumbles, overwhelmed by sheer power. His expression twists-not rage, but disbelief.

Meanwhile-

Inside the chaos of the battlefield, Nightwing and Robin shield Bruce's unconscious body. Parademons close in, but a surprised coordinated attack protects Batman. It was none another than Jason Todd and Tim Drake in their new upgraded aero-dynamic suits and upgraded weapons.

Jason smirks, cocking a pistol.

Jason (to Dick): "Bats looks worse than usual."

Dick (grinning): "He'll kill you when he wakes up."

Tim: "Assuming he wakes up."

Damian (snapping): "He will."

For the first time in history, all of Bruce's sons fight side by side.

Catwoman lands beside them, whip cracking, coordinating with uncanny precision. Together, the Bat-family forms a living shield around their fallen father-each strike, kick, and gadget flowing as if they've trained for this moment their entire lives.

It is the family's greatest fight.

Back at the center-Superman and Darkseid trade blows that rattle the city. Clark moves faster, hits harder, fueled by the sun's fire and years of restraint finally unleashed. With a devastating strike, he snaps Darkseid's arm, drawing a roar of pain from the god.

Darkseid collapses to the ground, for once vulnerable.

Clark hovers above him, eyes glowing, fists trembling with rage. Images flash through his mind-the Joker, the chaos, Bruce's near death, the years he wasn't there.

He slams his fist into Darkseid's chest. The shockwave cracks the ground for miles, hurling dust and debris outward like a hurricane. The earth itself trembles under his fury.

He raises his fist again, eyes blazing about to finish it. But he stops. His breathing slows. He looks down at the broken god of Apokolips.

Darkseid (spitting blood, snarling): "Pathetic… too weak to kill me."

Clark's voice is low, steady.

Superman: "I won't. That's what separates me from you."

But then, his tone hardens.

Superman (hovering above, burning eyes): "But you will never threaten my home again."

Twin beams of solar fire lance from his eyes-cutting into Darkseid's limbs, scorching his eyes, and tearing his back. Darkseid screams, collapsing helplessly into the dirt, crippled, unable to rise, stripped of his ability to fly.

Superman doesn't look back. He grabs the broken tyrant by the armor and drags his body toward the mothership.

In the distance, Flash and Shazam reappear, carrying hundreds of freed captives, signaling that the ships are clear.

Clark raises his voice, echoing across the battlefield.

Superman: "Everyone-fall back!"

The League, the Titans, and the armies pull away.

Superman floats above the ship, he hands Darkseid's defeated body to Wonder Woman, as she lets Queen Hippolyta restrain him. Superman's aura blazes brighter, surging to its peak. Then, with a thunderous cry, he unleashes a concentrated blast of solar energy.

The mothership erupts, consumed in a fireball of golden light. Every parademon within shrieks and disintegrates, their army destroyed in one cataclysmic stroke.

When the flames fade, Superman hovers alone in the smoke, Darkseid's body lifeless but breathing, broken beyond repair. Behind him, the League and Titans stare in awe-not at a god, but at the man they thought they had lost forever.

---

## CHAPTER 5: EPILOGUE

The sky burned with the remnants of war. Fragments of Apokoliptian ships rained like dying embers, dissolving into ash before they touched the ground. Superman descended through the haze, Darkseid's broken body trailing in his grasp, before dropping it lifeless at the battlefield's edge.

The League gathered. Exhausted, battered, but alive.

Flash stepped forward, still catching his breath.

Flash (smiling weakly): "Thanks… for saving us, big guy."

Hal Jordan crossed his arms, his ring flickering dim from overuse.

Green Lantern: "We did get reports about a ship orbiting near the sun. I knew there is nothing to worry about."

Diana sheathed her sword, her tone sharp but softened with relief.

Wonder Woman: "What took you so long, Kal?"

Superman's expression shifted-equal parts burden and confession.

Superman:

"It was a setup.

When I left Earth… I took the ship from the Fortress and exiled myself near the sun. I upgraded my comms, drew strength from its fire… learned to live within it. I became stronger-stronger than ever.

But while I lived there, I found… a different kind of purpose. I could hear across the stars, cries for help no one else could reach. I saved worlds at the far edge of the universe. Stopped wars. Prevented extinctions. But I never stayed. Never let myself belong anywhere.

Darkseid knew. He lured me away-invading a planet at the other end of the solar system. I fought, I won, but I saw Desaad escape. That should have told me everything… but by the time I returned to the sun, I heard the destruction from here, and the comms were dead, I knew it was a trick. Desaad must have given his master the signal.

My first instinct was to come home, but as soon as I came near Earth, the memories froze me. The pain of what I left behind.

Until I heard Bruce. His scream. His heart slowing. That's when I realized… if I hesitated any longer, it would be too late. That's why it took me so long."

Silence fell over the battlefield. Not judgment, not anger-only the weight of understanding. Each of them processed his words in their own way.

Clark turned to where Nightwing and Robin knelt at Bruce's side. The Dark Knight was still unconscious, but breathing steady, thanks to Mera and Superman's healing.

Superman (to Nightwing and Robin):

"When he wakes… tell him I want to talk. Outside the manor. At night. One week from now."

His eyes lingered on Bruce for a moment longer-a mixture of guilt, longing, and the beginnings of hope. Then, with a rush of golden light, he took to the skies, vanishing into the night beyond the smoke.

The League and Titans stood together in the ruins of the battlefield, watching the last son of Krypton disappear into the stars. For the first time in ten years, the world felt like it had a future again.

WAYNE MANOR

_(One Week Later)_

The war was over. Darkseid had been captured-sealed away by the Amazons in a prison of eternal binding, never to leave the ruins of the city again. Diana had been given permission by her mother to visit him, and she left Themyscira with a sense of relief.

On Earth, news stations replayed endless footage of the battle-images of Superman's return, the League's unity, and the scars left on Metropolis. The world whispered with awe and hope.

But at Wayne Manor, things were quieter.

Bruce sat outside in his wheelchair, Selina standing at his side. The night air was calm, the moonlight spilling across the old stone walls. The front gates stood open.

A sudden rush of wind, and Superman descended from the sky, radiating in solar energy, shining like a dragon fly, lands silently to Bruce's right.

Bruce turned to Selina.

Bruce: "Go inside. Please. I would like to talk to him alone."

Selina nodded softly before slipping into the manor.

There was a long pause between them. The silence of two men who had once been brothers in arms, now weathered by time.

Superman: "How are you holding up?"

Bruce (with a dry half-smile): "Healthy enough to still be alive. But… probably never walking again."

Clark lowered his gaze.

Superman: "…I'm sorry."

Bruce shook his head slightly.

Bruce: "So. You wanted to talk?"

Superman exhaled, his voice heavy, almost reluctant.

Superman: "When I fought Darkseid… when he was down on the ground… I looked at him, and for a moment, I didn't see Darkseid. I saw Joker. I lost myself, Bruce. I almost killed him. I wanted to.

But then… I stopped. Because I remembered what you told me years ago.

Tell me… when you chased criminals all those years, when they reminded you of the pain and injustice that shaped your life… how did you not give in? How did you keep choosing the right path?"

Bruce's expression hardened, though his voice was steady-measured, like a truth he'd carried his entire life.

Bruce:

"If you want to change the world, Clark… you must first change yourself.

When I chose this path, I accepted what justice truly meant. I knew that if I crossed that line-if I killed out of vengeance, out of hate-then I wouldn't be any different from the people I swore to stop. I'd just be another man driven by selfish motives.

We united once… not just to fight villains, but to stand for an ideal. To show people that justice doesn't come from chaos-it comes from restraint, from law, from hope. If even one of us abandoned that… the world would've lost faith. And everything would've fallen into ruin."

Superman was silent. Stunned. His breath caught as Bruce's words cut deeper than any wound. His eyes shone-not with heat vision, but with emotion.

Superman (quietly): "…Thank you, Bruce. I understand now. If I had killed Joker… or if you had ever killed anyone… there'd be no difference between us and them.

Thank you for saving me. Again.

I can't undo what I've lost… but I can honor it. I'll live by your words. I'll save as many as I can. And I'll pass that message on."

For a moment, neither spoke. The night was still, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the faint hum of crickets. Two men-one broken but unyielding, the other reborn in fire-sat together in understanding.

The world would never know of this conversation. But it would feel its echo for generations.

Bruce: "There's… one more thing."

He pulls out his phone and makes a call.

Diana, Barry, Hal, Arthur, Billy, and Conner, walks out and gather in the moonlit courtyard, smiles and relief on their faces as Superman sees them. Superman is happy to see his friends again.

Superman's eyes soften when he sees Conner.

Superman: "How are you, Conner?"

Conner (smiling proudly): "I'm good. I'm married to Megan now."

Superman: "I'm really ha-"

His voice falters. His breath catches.

Because he finally sees her.

Sitting in the wheelchair, guided by Selina, along with Damian and Dick… is Martha Kent.

Clark's eyes widen, disbelief flooding his face. His lips tremble as he whispers-

Superman: "…Mom?"

Martha's eyes well with tears.

Martha: "Clark."

She reaches her hands toward him, overwhelmed with joy. Clark stumbles forward, his cape dragging on the grass, as if afraid that if he blinked, she would vanish.

Superman (kneeling by her side, voice breaking): "How… how is this possible? What happened?"

Martha places her trembling hand on his cheek.

Martha:

"That day… your father and I were on our way to visit you and Lois. We were so excited. But then the shockwave from the explosion… it threw our car off the road. We crashed, both of us unconscious.

When I woke up, Bruce was there. He was speaking to the doctor. He was so relieved when he saw me awake… he said I reminded him of his own mother.

But…" (her voice breaks) "…your father didn't make it."

She begins to sob.

Clark's face collapses. The Man of Steel falls to his knees in front of her, burying his face in her lap, tears streaming down his glowing cheeks. His shoulders shake, the weight of ten years lifting and crashing down at once.

The League watches silently, their hearts heavy.

Diana presses her hand to her chest. A single tear escapes as she remembers her mother, Hippolyta-the countless years she spent apart from her. She whispers under her breath, "Cherish this, Kal. Never let go of it."

Barry shifts awkwardly, his hands clenched into fists. His thoughts go to his father, unjustly locked away, and to his mother-gone too soon. His throat tightens. He forces a smile.

Hal Jordan lowers his head, a rare softness in his eyes. He remembers his own father, the test pilot whose death set him on the path to fear and courage.

Arthur places a hand on Mera's shoulder, glancing toward Clark and Martha. "Family," he says, voice quiet but heavy. "It's the only anchor that keeps us from drowning." Mera nods, squeezing his hand in agreement.

Billy Batson doesn't say a word, but his expression is unlike the others. He doesn't see the Man of Steel kneeling in the grass. He sees a boy-just like him-broken, vulnerable, needing his mother.

Dick and Damian exchange glances. For once, even Damian doesn't have a sharp remark. The brothers simply watch, silently grateful that Bruce had been able to give Clark this piece of peace.

Bruce lingers the longest, standing in the shadows, watching Clark embrace the only piece of Smallville he had left. Then he steps closer and rests a hand on Superman's shoulder.

Bruce (quietly): "Stay the night, Clark. Be with her."

Superman nods wordlessly, unable to speak.

One by one, the League begins to move back into the manor, giving mother and son the space they deserve. The camera lingers on Clark and Martha under the moonlight, framed against the dark silhouette of Wayne Manor, the two holding onto each other as if the universe itself had conspired to bring them back together.

For the first time in ten years, Clark Kent is home.

_(few days later, after Superman caught up with his mother and his friends)_

_Ext. Smallville Cemetery - Morning_

The sun rises over the quiet fields, bathing the cemetery in golden light. Dew glistens on the grass. Superman kneels before two headstones-Jonathan Kent and Lois Lane-Kent. He rests his hand on the earth, eyes closed. A breeze rustles the nearby trees. The grief is still there, but in daylight, it feels less like despair and more like acceptance.

_Ext. Metropolis Monument_

He also visits the Metropolis monument, seeing the statue, and looking at the names of the victims.

Superman stands slowly, cape brushing across the morning wind. He gives one final glance at the city once he considered his home, then lifts into the sky, soaring toward a new purpose.

_Ext. Wayne Manor - Backyard - Late Morning_

The grounds are alive with movement. The sun climbs higher, casting sharp shadows across the lawn. A sleek interstellar vessel hums softly, prepared for departure.

Gathered are Green Lantern, Nightwing, Flash, Kid Flash, Starfire, and Miss Martian. Armor gleams under the daylight. Their faces carry determination but also hope-the calm before war.

Superman descends from the sky, landing with quiet strength. All eyes turn to him.

Superman: "The threat isn't over. Not while Desaad walks free. We finish this together."

The team nods in silent agreement.

From the manor steps, Connor Kent approaches.

Connor: "I can still come with you."

Superman smiles faintly. He steps closer, resting a hand over Connor's chest.

Superman: "You could have. But there's a reason you must stay."

He channels his Kryptonian energy-light surges from his palm into Connor, awakening hidden abilities. Connor breathes sharply, his body glowing for a moment before stabilizing.

Superman: "From now on… you are the hope of this world. I've left a gift for my mom. Make sure you visit her."

Connor's eyes glisten. He nods firmly, pride replacing hesitation.

Superman turns toward Bruce, who watches from his wheelchair near the balcony.

Superman: "I'll see you around."

Bruce (steady): "We will."

Nightwing leads the team aboard the ship. Its engines flare. Superman rises into the air, flying alongside it as if guiding their path. The craft ascends toward the sky, its reflection catching the sun.

Superman glances back down one last time at Connor, still standing on the lawn.

Superman (soft, almost to himself): "Your future starts now."

Then he rockets upward, breaking through the clouds. The ship follows into the atmosphere.

_Int. Wayne Manor - Late Morning_

Connor steps inside, carrying the weight of Superman's words. In the sitting room, Martha Kent waits by the window, sunlight pouring in.

Martha: "You came, boy. My son has been looking forward to this for a long time."

She carefully unfolds Superman's mantle, holding it out. The sunlight illuminates the fabric, red and blue glowing as if alive.

Connor takes it reverently, both hands trembling. His eyes widen-he is overwhelmed, honored.

Martha: "Carry it well."

CAMERA CLOSES on the suit, gleaming in morning light-the legacy now passed on.

**THE END**
